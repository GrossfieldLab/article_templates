\begin{abstract}

Software is ubiquitous in modern science --- almost any project, in almost any
discipline, requires some code to work. However, many (or even most) scientists
are not programmers, and must rely on programs written and maintained by others.
As a result, a crucial but often neglected part of a scientist's training is
learning how to use new tools, and how to exist as part of a community of users.
This article will discuss key behaviors that can make the experience quicker,
more efficient, and more pleasant for the user and developer alike.

\section{Introduction}

Most practicing scientists (even the ones who write code as part of their
research) spend more time as consumers as opposed to producers of software.
Moreover, we are constantly learning new skills and solving new problems, which
often means learning to use new programs or new aspects of large packages. This,
combined with the complex nature of scientific software (and the often low
quality of the associated documentation) means we have to ask for help.
Sometimes it's because we don't know how to accomplish a specific task. Others,
it's because there's a feature we need that isn't implemented. Inevitably, there
are bugs.

In all of these cases, it is necessary to interact with the people who develop
and support the code. How you go about it has an enormous impact on your
likelihood of success and how you are viewed, but this is not something that is
explicitly taught in most places.  {\emph The goal of this paper is to reveal
the hidden curriculum -- what's expected of a software consumer, how to ask for
help, how to contribute productively to a software community (regardless of
whether you can write code).}

Asking strangers for help can be intimidating, regardless of your

There lots of articles on best practices in software development, including open
source.

emphasize the idea of a social contract: what do developers owe the users, what
do users owe developers, what do users owe other users

connect to open science: FAIR principles say developers should want code to be
reusable. Publishing the code isn't enough, you need to make it usable as well.
That means support.

\section{Target Audience}

This paper is primarily aimed at junior scientists who are new to performing
research and inexperienced at asking for help. However, we hope it will be
valuable to anyone who uses software to do their research and struggles to ask
for help.



\section{Checklists}
% Here is a single-column checklist that consists of multiple sub-checklists
\begin{Checklists}

\begin{checklist}{Good community member}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tries to solve problem themselves first
\item Asks for help in the right place
\item Writes informative bug reports
\item Cites and acknowledges software appropriately
\item Contributes to the community
\item Treats fellow members and developers with courtesy and respect
\end{itemize}
\end{checklist}

\begin{checklist}{Poor community member}
\begin{itemize}
\item Doesn't read the manual or search the internet before asking for help
\item Doesn't use the correct venue to ask for help
\item Writes vague or unhelpful bug reports, or doesn't respond to questions
\item Is rude or demanding when requesting support
\item Treats fellow community members disrespectfully
\end{itemize}
\end{checklist}

\begin{checklist}{A good community}
\begin{itemize}
\item Helps users solve their problems
\item Is friendly and supportive when responding to questions
\item Is receptive to suggestions and critiques, regardless of the source
\item Encourages participation from users of all experience levels
\item Encourages respectful treatment of all community members, and calls out disrespectful behavior
\end{itemize}
\end{checklist}
