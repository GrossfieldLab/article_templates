\begin{abstract}

Software is ubiquitous in modern science --- almost any project, in almost any
discipline, requires some code to work. However, many (or even most) scientists
are not programmers, and must rely on programs written and maintained by others.
As a result, a crucial but often neglected part of a scientist's training is
learning how to use new tools, and how to exist as part of a community of users.
This article will discuss key behaviors that can make the experience quicker,
more efficient, and more pleasant for the user and developer alike.

\section{Introduction}

Most practicing scientists (even the ones who write code as part of their
research) spend more time as consumers as opposed to producers of software.
Moreover, we are constantly learning new skills and solving new problems, which
often means learning to use new programs or new aspects of large packages. This,
combined with the complex nature of scientific software (and the often low
quality of the associated documentation) means we have to ask for help.
Sometimes it's because we don't know how to accomplish a specific task. Others,
it's because there's a feature we need that isn't implemented. Inevitably, there
are bugs.

In all of these cases, it is necessary to interact with the people who develop
and support the code. How you go about it has an enormous impact on your
likelihood of success and how you are viewed, and asking complete strangers for
help is often intimidating, especially the first time you do it. However, the
best way to do so is rarely taught explicitly --- at best, it's something one
picks up by example, from fellow lab members or the PI.  {\emph The goal of this
paper is to reveal the hidden curriculum -- what's expected of a software
consumer, how to ask for help, how to contribute productively to a software
community (regardless of whether you can write code).}

This article is written from a perspective of academic open-source scientific
software. Much of what we suggest is universal, but some points --- like the
reminder that the people providing the support are likely volunteers --- are
not.  Regardless, we view the interaction between developers and users as an
informal social contract, where each has obligations and expectations for the
other. Obviously, every software community is unique, and many have specific
conventions for interaction, but we hope that the recommendations we make are at
the very least a good starting point for new users of scientific software.



connect to open science: FAIR principles say developers should want code to be
reusable. Publishing the code isn't enough, you need to make it usable as well.
That means support.

\section{Target Audience}

This paper is primarily aimed at junior scientists who are new to performing
research and inexperienced at asking for help. However, we hope it will be
valuable to anyone who uses software to do their research and struggles to ask
for help.

\section{Good practices in asking for help}

\subsection{Try to solve your own problem}

There's absolutely nothing wrong with needing help to figure out how to do
something with a new piece of software. Perhaps your use case wasn't considered
in the manual, or you're seeing behavior you don't expect. Perhaps you can't
even get it to install. Asking for help is very reasonable --- the developers
want people to use their software, and with that comes an implied obligation to
support those users. However, keep in mind that the developers of scientific
software are, for the most part, volunteering their time to provide that
support, and as such it's important to respect their time.

For this reason, asking the developers for help shouldn't be the \emph{first}
thing you do. Especially for software with a large community, chances are
someone else has run into similar difficulties, and you can probably save
yourself and the developers a lot of time if you look for solutions on your own
first. Indeed, quickly debugging your use of others' software is one of the
major skills one develops when learning to do computational research.

The first step is to check the manual. This might seem trivially obvious, but you'd be astonished how many emails developers get that are directly answered in the manual.

This might be an actual standalone
manual, or part of the web page for the software package, but if it exists it
should be your first stop. Look for a frequently asked questions list on the web site,

Search the internet for the error message (this works very well for software with thousands of users, less well with smaller packages)

\section{Obligations of software developers}

This paper has focused on what software consumers should do when asking for
help.  However, this does not mean that the developers of scientific software
are without responsibilities. If we want users to behave in a certain way, it
behooves us to tell them that. Users approaching us in good faith deserve to be
treated fairly and courteously.

\section{Checklists}
% Here is a single-column checklist that consists of multiple sub-checklists
\begin{Checklists}

\begin{checklist}{Good community member}
\begin{itemize}
\item Tries to solve problem themselves first
\item Asks for help in the right place
\item Writes informative bug reports
\item Cites and acknowledges software appropriately
\item Treats fellow members and developers with courtesy and respect
\item Contributes to the community
\end{itemize}
\end{checklist}

\begin{checklist}{Poor community member}
\begin{itemize}
\item Doesn't read the manual or search the internet before asking for help
\item Doesn't use the correct venue to ask for help
\item Writes vague or unhelpful bug reports, or doesn't respond to questions
\item Is rude or demanding when requesting support
\item Treats fellow community members disrespectfully
\end{itemize}
\end{checklist}

\begin{checklist}{A good community}
\begin{itemize}
\item Helps users solve their problems
\item Is friendly and supportive when responding to questions
\item Is receptive to suggestions and critiques, regardless of the source
\item Encourages participation from users of all experience levels
\item Encourages respectful treatment of all community members, and calls out disrespectful behavior
\end{itemize}
\end{checklist}

\end{Checklists}
