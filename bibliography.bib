The stability constant for this system in acetonitrile at the same temperature was measured by competitive potentiometric titration using silver electrodes. Gibbs energies of complexation in a variety of solvents are analyzed in terms of corresponding data for the transfer of ligand and free and complexed cation. Standard enthalpies of solution of barium perchlorate in N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethyl sulfoxide, acetonitrile, and propylene carbonate and for barium-cryptand 222 perchlorate in water, methanol, N,N- dimethylformamide, and dimethyl sulfoxide measured calorimetrically at 298.15 K are reported. The data show that in these solvents the former electrolyte is more solvated than the latter. Single-ion values of transfer enthalpies for the free and complexed cations are calculated on the basis of the Ph(4)AsPh(4)B convention. These data and those previously reported for the transfer enthalpy of cryptand 222 among these solvents are used to explain the variation observed in the complexation enthalpies of Ba2+ and this ligand in the various solvents. Coordination enthalpies for the process in the solid state derived from six different solvents are for the first time reported. The agreement found between the values derived from independent measurements reflect the reliability of complexation and solution data reported in this paper. The relationship between complexation and solvation entropy of barium is discussed taking into account previous thermodynamic data on univalent cations and cryptand 222. It is concluded that the effective shielding effect of the ligand for univalent cations weakens considerably for barium and breaks completely for some of the lanthanide cations as assessed from thermochemical data on these systems.},

To ensure that the data are referred exclusively to the complexation process, salts containing highly polarizable anions (hexafluoroasenate, tetrafluoroborate, trifluoromethanesulfonate, and perchlorate) are used as sources for lithium. From stability constants and standard enthalpies, standard Gibbs energies and standard entropies are calculated. In propylene carbonate, a correlation is found between the stability of the lithium crown complex and the increase in conductance of the complexed relative to the free cation. Eight new lithium coronand salts of 12-crown-4 and 1-benzyl-1-aza-12-crown-4 were isolated. Standard enthalpies of these salts and crown ethers in acetonitrile and propylene carbonate at 298.15 K measured calorimetrically are used to explain (i) the higher molar ionic conductivities, observed for lithium coronand relative to lithium electrolytes, and (ii) the effect of the solution properties of ligand, free, and complexed cation in the binding of these ligands with lithium in these solvents. Enthalpies of coordination first reported show the anion effect in the process involving reactants and product in their pure physical state. The strength of cation- anion interaction follows the sequence ClO4- > CF3SO3- > AsF6- > BF4-.},

These data are compared with those previously reported for cryptand 222 and these cations in this solvent. A ''peak'' selectivity is observed for the complexation of the calix(6)arene ester and alkali metal cations with a monotonic increase in stability from lithium to potassium followed by a decrease from the latter to rubidium. This behavior is analogous to that shown for cation binding involving 18-crown-6 and cryptand 222. Similar to the process of complex formation involving these ligands, that involving the calix(6)arene ester and these metal cations is enthalpy controlled with an exothermic maximum for the potassium cation. Among the ligands considered, thermodynamic data involving cation-calix(6)arene ester interactions are characterized by a lower enthalpic stability (less exothermic) and a more favorable entropy (except for KC) than corresponding data involving cryptand 222 or indeed 18-crown-6. These results are analysed in terms of solute-solvent interactions reflected on the solution thermodynamic data of the free and the complexed electrolytes and the ligand in benzonitrile. Standard enthalpies of solution of macrocycles and their sodium and potassium salts in benzonitrile measured calorimetrically are discussed in relation to (i) corresponding data for the uncomplexed salts and (ii) previously reported data for sodium and potassium cryptate salts in various solvents, Enthalpies of coordination referred to the process in the solid state for eighteen systems involving sodium and potassium coronates, cryptates, and calix(6)arenates are derived and whenever possible these are discussed on the basis of (i) available X-ray crystallographic data and (ii) the anion effect on the coordination process.},

  Abstract                 = {Retinal is the natural ligand (chromophore) of the vertebrate rod visual pigment. It occurs in either the 11-cis (rhodopsin) or the 9-cis (isorhodopsin) configuration. In its evolution to a G protein coupled photoreceptor, rhodopsin has acquired exceptional photochemical properties. Illumination isomerizes the chromophore to the all-trans isomer, which acts as a full agonist. This process is extremely efficient, and there is abundant evidence that the C-9 and C-13 methyl groups of retinal play a pivotal role in this process. To examine the steric limits of the C-9 and C-13 methyl binding pocket of the binding site, we have prepared C-9 and C-13 cyclopropyl and isopropyl derivatives of its native ligands and of Î±-retinal at C-9. Most isopropyl analogues show very poor binding, except for 9-cis-13-isopropylretinal. Most cyclopropyl derivatives exhibit intermediate binding activity, except for 9-cis-13-cyclopropylretinal, which presents good binding activity. In general, the binding site shows preference for the 9-cis analogues over the 11-cis analogues. In fact, 13-isopropyl-9-cis-retinal acts as a superagonist after illumination. Another surprising finding was that 9-cyclopropylisorhodopsin is more like native rhodopsin with respect to spectral and photochemical properties, whereas 9-cyclopropylrhodopsin behaves more like native isorhodopsin in these aspects.},

  abstract             = {Abstract: Temporin-SHa and temporin-SHc are 13 residue long antimicrobial peptides from frog skin that have similar sequences but differ markedly in their membrane-damaging properties. Temporin-SHa contains a single basic lysine residue and has a unique antimicrobial spectrum of action among temporins, being very potent against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, fungi, and protozoa. Temporin-SHc, which contains a single basic histidine residue, is inactive against Gram-negative bacteria, has a reduced efficacy against Gram-positive bacteria, but is still active against yeasts and fungi. Temporin-SHb, with no basic residue, has no antimicrobial activity. The three-dimensional structures of the peptides bound to SDS micelles were analyzed by CD and NMR spectroscopy combined with restrained molecular dynamics calculations. The peptides adopt well-defined amphipathic ÃÂ±-helical structures extending from residue 3 to residue 12, when bound to SDS micelles. The structures are stabilized by extensive interactions between aliphatic and aromatic side chains on the nonpolar face. Relaxation enhancements caused by paramagnetic probes showed that the peptides adopt nearly parallel orientations to the micelle surface and do not deeply penetrate into the micelle. The interaction of the peptides with model membranes was investigated by differential scanning calorimetry on anionic and zwitterionic multilamellar vesicles and membrane-permeabilization assays on calcein-loaded large unilamellar vesicles. Calorimetric data indicated that both temporin-SHa and -SHc reside at the hydrocarbon corewater interface of the anionic lipid bilayer but interact with anionic bilayers in a very different manner. This suggests that the charge-induced activity of temporins-SH for bacterial cells is due to changes in the membrane-disturbing mechanism of the bound peptides.},

  Abstract                 = {Mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae defective in the late steps of ergosterol biosynthesis are viable but accumulate structurally altered sterols within the plasma membrane. Despite the significance of pleiotropic abnormalities in the erg mutants, little is known about how sterol alterations mechanically affect the membrane structure and correlate with individual mutant phenotypes. Here we demonstrate that the membrane order and occurrence of voids are determinants of membrane rigidity and hypersensitivity to a drug. Among five ergDelta mutants, the erg2Delta mutant exhibited the most marked sensitivity to cycloheximide. Notably, measurement of time-resolved anisotropy indicated that the erg2Delta mutation decreased the membrane order parameter (S), and dramatically increased the rotational diffusion coefficient (D(w)) of 1-[4-(trimethylamino)pheny]-6-phenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (TMA-DPH) in the plasma membrane by 8-fold, providing evidence for the requirement of ergosterol for membrane integrity. The IC(50) of cycloheximide was closely correlated with S/D(w) in these strains, suggesting that the membrane disorder and increasing occurrence of voids within the plasma membrane synergistically enhance passive diffusion of cycloheximide across the membrane. Exogenous ergosterol partially restored the membrane properties in the upc2-1erg2Delta strain. In this study, we describe the ability of ergosterol to adjust the dynamic properties of the plasma membrane, and consider the relevance of drug permeability.},

  Abstract                 = {The pH titration studies (pH 6.7-12.1) in a series of dimeric, trimeric, tetrameric, pentameric, and hexameric oligo-RNA molecules [GpA (2a), GpC (3a), GpApC (5), GpA(1)pA(2)pC (6), GpA(1)pA(2)pA(3)pC (7), GpA(1)pA(2)pA(3)pA(4)pC (8)] have shown that the pK(a) of N(1)-H of 9-guaninyl could be measured not only from its own deltaH8G, but also from the aromatic marker protons of other constituent nucleobases. The relative chemical shift differences [Deltadelta((N)(-)(D))] between the protons in various nucleotide residues in the oligo-RNAs at the neutral (N) and deprotonated (D) states of the guanine moiety show that the generation of the 5'-(9-guanylate ion) in oligo-RNAs 2-8 reduces the stability of the stacked helical RNA conformation owing to the destabilizing anion(G(-))-pi/dipole(Im(delta)(-)) interaction. This destabilizing effect in the deprotonated RNA is, however, opposed by the electrostatically attractive atom-pisigma (major) as well as the anion(G(-))-pi/dipole(Py(delta)(+)) (minor) interactions. Our studies have demonstrated that the electrostatically repulsive anion(G(-))-pi/dipole(Im(delta)(-)) interaction propagates from the first to the third nucleobase quite strongly in the oligo-RNAs 6-8, causing destacking of the helix, and then its effect is gradually reduced, although it is clearly NMR detectable along the RNA chain. Thus, such specific generation of a charge at a single nucleobase moiety allows us to explore the relative strength of stacking within a single-stranded helix. The pK(a) of 5'-Gp residue from its own deltaH8G in the hexameric RNA 8 is found to be 9.76 +/- 0.01; it, however, varies from 9.65 +/- 0.01 to 10.5 +/- 0.07 along the RNA chain as measured from the other marker protons (H2, H8, H5, and H6) of 9-adeninyl and 1-cytosinyl residues. This nucleobase-dependent modulation of pK(a)s (DeltapK(a) +/- 0.9) of 9-guaninyl obtained from other nucleobases in the hexameric RNA 8 represents a difference of ca. 5.1 kJ mol(-)(1), which has been attributed to the variable strength of electrostatic interactions between the electron densities of the involved atoms in the offset stacked nucleobases as well as with that of the phosphates. The chemical implication of this variable pK(a) for guanin-9-yl deprotonation as obtained from all other marker protons of each nucleotide residue within a ssRNA molecule is that it enables us to experimentally understand the variation of the electronic microenvironment around each constituent nucleobase along the RNA chain in a stepwise manner with very high accuracy without having to make any assumption. This means that the pseudoaromaticity of neighboring 9-adeninyl and next-neighbor nucleobases within a polyanionic sugar-phosphate backbone of a ssRNA can vary from one case to another due to cross-modulation of an electronically coupled pi system by a neighboring nucleobase. This modulation may depend on the sequence context, spatial proximity of the negatively charged phosphates, as well as whether the offset stacking is ON or OFF. The net outcome of this electrostatic interaction between the neighbors is creation of new sequence-dependent hybrid nucleobases in an oligo- or polynucleotide whose properties are unlike the monomeric counterpart, which may have considerable biological implications.},

  Abstract                 = {Sodium coupled cotransporters of the five-helix inverted repeat (5HIR) superfamily use an alternating access mechanism to transport a myriad of small molecules across the cell membrane. One of the primary steps in this mechanism is the conformational transition from a state poised to bind extracellular substrates to a state that is competent to deliver substrate to the cytoplasm. Here, we construct a coarse-grained model of the 5HIR benzylhydantoin transporter Mhp1 that incorporates experimental structures of the outward- and inward-open states to investigate the mechanism of this conformational change. Using the weighted ensemble path-sampling method, we rigorously sample the outward- to inward-facing transition path ensemble. The transition path ensemble reveals a heterogeneous set of pathways connecting the two states and identifies two modes of transport: one consistent with a strict alternating access mechanism and another where decoupling of the inner and outer gates causes the transient formation of a continuous permeation pathway through the transporter. We also show that the conformational switch between the outward- and inward-open states results from rigid body motions of the hash motif relative to the substrate bundle, supporting the rocking bundle hypothesis. Finally, our methodology provides the groundwork for more chemically detailed investigations of the alternating mechanism.},

  abstract =    {Limited searching in the conformational space is one of the major obstacles for investigating protein dynamics by numerical approaches. For this reason, classical all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins tend to be confined to local energy minima, particularly when the bulk solvent is treated explicitly. To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel replica exchange protocol that uses modified force-field parameters to treat interparticle nonbonded potentials within the protein and between protein and solvent atoms, leaving unperturbed those relative to solvent-solvent interactions. We have tested the new protocol on the 18-residue-long tip of the P domain of calreticulin in an explicit solvent. With only eight replicas, we have been able to considerably enhance the conformational space sampled during a 100 ns simulation, compared to as many parallel classical molecular dynamics simulations of the same length or to a single one lasting 450 ns. A direct comparison between the various simulations has been possible thanks to the implementation of the weighted histogram analysis method, by which conformations simulated with modified force-field parameters can be assigned different weights. Interatom, inter-residue distances in the structural ensembles obtained with our novel replica exchange approach and by classical MD simulations compare equally well with those derived from NMR data. Rare events, such as unfolding and refolding, occur with reasonable statistical frequency. Visiting of conformations characterized by very small Boltzmann weights is also possible. Despite their low probability, such regions of the conformational space may play an important role in the search for local potential-energy minima and in dynamically controlled functions.},

  abstract    = {Implants invoke inflammatory responses from the body even if they are chemically inert and nontoxic. It has been shown that a crucial precedent event in the inflammatory process is the spontaneous adsorption of fibrinogen (Fg) on implant surfaces, which is typically followed by the presence of phagocytic cells. Interactions between the phagocyte integrin Mac-1 and two short sequences within the fibrinogen gamma chain, gamma190-202 and gamma377-395, may partially explain phagocyte accumulation at implant surfaces. These two sequences are believed to form an integrin binding site that is inaccessible when Fg is in its soluble-state structure but then becomes available for Mac-1 binding following adsorption, presumably due to adsorption-induced conformational changes. The objective of this research was to theoretically investigate this possibility by using molecular dynamics simulations of the gamma-chain fragment of Fg over self-assembled monolayer (SAM) surfaces presenting different types of surface chemistry. The GROMACS software package was used to carry out the molecular simulations in an explicit solvation environment over a 5 ns period of time. The adsorption of the gamma-chain of fibrinogen was simulated on five types of SAM surfaces. The simulations showed that this protein fragment exhibits distinctly different adsorption behavior on the different surface chemistries. Although the trajectory files showed that significant conformational changes did not occur in this protein fragment over the time frame of the simulations, it was predicted that the protein does undergo substantial rotational and translational motions over the surface prior to stabilizing in various preferred orientations. This suggests that the kinetics of surface-induced conformational changes in a protein's structure might be much slower than the kinetics of orientational changes, thus enabling the principles of adsorption thermodynamics to be used to guide adsorbing proteins into defined orientations on surfaces before large conformational changes can occur. This finding may be very important for biomaterial surface design as it suggests that surface chemistry can potentially be used to directly control the orientation of adsorbing proteins in a manner that either presents or hides specific bioactive sites contained within a protein's structure, thereby providing a mechanism to control cellular responses to the adsorbed protein layer.},

  abstract =             {PMID: 20025243 In addition to the heptahelical transmembrane domain shared by all G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), many class A GPCRs adopt a helical domain, termed helix 8, in the membrane-proximal region of the C terminus. We investigated the role of residues in the hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces of amphiphilic helix 8 of human cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). To differentiate between a role for specific residues and global features, we made two key mutants: one involving replacement of the highly hydrophobic groups, Leu404, Phe408, and Phe412, all with alanine and the second involving substitution of the basic residues, Lys402, Arg405, and Arg409, all with the neutral glutamine. The former showed a very low Bmax based on binding isotherms, a minimal Emax based on GTPÃÂ³S binding analysis, and defective localization relative to the wild-type CB1 receptor as revealed by confocal microscopy. However, the latter mutant and the wild-type receptors were indistinguishable. Circular dichroism spectroscopy of purified peptides with corresponding sequences indicated that the highly hydrophobic residues are critical for maintaining a strong helical structure in detergent, whereas the positively charged residues are not. Further investigation of mutant receptors revealed that CB1 localization requires a threshold level of hydrophobicity but not specific amino acids. Moreover, mutant receptors carrying two- to six-residue insertions amino-terminal to helix 8 revealed a graded decrease in Bmax values. Our results identify the key helix 8 components (including hydrophobicity of specific residues, structure, and location relative to TM7) determinant for receptor localization leading to robust ligand binding and G protein activation.},

  abstract    = {Rhodopsin is a highly specialized G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is activated by the rapid photochemical isomerization of its covalently bound 11-cis-retinal chromophore. Using two-dimensional solid-state NMR spectroscopy, we defined the position of the retinal in the active metarhodopsin II intermediate. Distance constraints were obtained between amino acids in the retinal binding site and specific (13)C-labeled sites located on the beta-ionone ring, polyene chain, and Schiff base end of the retinal. We show that the retinal C20 methyl group rotates toward the second extracellular loop (EL2), which forms a cap on the retinal binding site in the inactive receptor. Despite the trajectory of the methyl group, we observed an increase in the C20-Gly(188) (EL2) distance consistent with an increase in separation between the retinal and EL2 upon activation. NMR distance constraints showed that the beta-ionone ring moves to a position between Met(207) and Phe(208) on transmembrane helix H5. Movement of the ring toward H5 was also reflected in increased separation between the Cepsilon carbons of Lys(296) (H7) and Met(44) (H1) and between Gly(121) (H3) and the retinal C18 methyl group. Helix-helix interactions involving the H3-H5 and H4-H5 interfaces were also found to change in the formation of metarhodopsin II reflecting increased retinal-protein interactions in the region of Glu(122) (H3) and His(211) (H5). We discuss the location of the retinal in metarhodopsin II and its interaction with sequence motifs, which are highly conserved across the pharmaceutically important class A GPCR family, with respect to the mechanism of receptor activation.},

Distance measurements using solid-state (13)C NMR spectroscopy between the retinal chromophore and the beta4 strand of EL2 show that the loop is displaced from the retinal binding site upon activation, and there is a rearrangement in the hydrogen-bonding networks connecting EL2 with the extracellular ends of transmembrane helices H4, H5 and H6. NMR measurements further reveal that structural changes in EL2 are coupled to the motion of helix H5 and breaking of the ionic lock that regulates activation.

These receptors have a relatively simple architecture consisting of seven transmembrane helices that contain just a handful of highly conserved amino acids, yet they respond to light and a range of chemically diverse ligands. Recent NMR structural studies on the active metarhodopsin II intermediate of the visual receptor rhodopsin, along with the recent crystal structure of the apoprotein opsin, have revealed multiple structural elements or 'switches' that must be simultaneously triggered to achieve full activation. The confluence of several required structural changes is an example of "coincidence counting", which is often used by nature to regulate biological processes. In ligand-activated G protein-coupled receptors, the presence of multiple switches may provide an explanation for the differences between full, partial and inverse agonists.},

  abstract =             {Aim This study was performed to isolate and characterize novel antifungal peptide from Bacillus cereus. Methods and Results Elucidation of its chemical structure was carried out by electrospray ionization mass spectra (ESIÃ¢ÂÂMS) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTÃ¢ÂÂIR). The compound is a cyclic heptapeptide and composed of amino acids, LeuÃ¢ÂÂAspÃ¢ÂÂValÃ¢ÂÂLeuÃ¢ÂÂLeuÃ¢ÂÂLeuÃ¢ÂÂLeu. The in vitro activity of Kannurin against various pathogenic yeasts was assessed by CLSI M27Ã¢ÂÂA and molds by M38Ã¢ÂÂA. It demonstrated broadÃ¢ÂÂspectrum, fungicidal activity against clinically relevant yeasts and molds. Kannurin exhibited low haemolytic activity and remained active over a wide pH and temperature range. In addition, Kannurin did not bind with melanin particles and was as active in inhibiting biofilms. Conclusions An antifungal surfactinÃ¢ÂÂlike lipopeptide produced by Bacillus cereus strain AK1 was purified and chemically characterised. We propose to name this lipopeptide compound Kannurin. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Bacillus cereus producing surfactin like lipopeptide antibiotic with stronger antifungal activity. Significance and Impact of the Study Our results provide a valuable contribution towards a better understanding of the lipopeptide of Bacillus cereus. Moreover, it raises the possibility of using as an alternative antibiotic in clinical medicine. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.},

  abstract             = {Formation of rafts and other domains in cell membranes is considered as wetting of proteins by lipids. The membrane is modeled as a continuous elastic medium. Thermodynamic functions of the lipid films that wet proteins are calculated using a mean-field theory of liquid crystals as adapted to biomembranes. This approach yields the conditions necessary for a macroscopic wetting film to form; its thickness could also be determined. It is shown that films of macroscopic thicknesses form around large (tens nanometers in diameter) lipid-protein aggregates; only thin adsorption films form around single proteins or small complexes. The means by which wetting films can facilitate the merger of these aggregates is considered. It is shown that a wetting film prevents a protein from leaving an aggregate. Using experimentally derived values of elastic moduli and spontaneous curvatures as well as height mismatch between aggregates and bulk membrane, we obtained numerical results, which can be compared with the experimental data.

  Abstract                 = {Bacillus subtilis produces various families of lipopeptides with different homologous compounds. To produce "new molecules" with improved activities and to select strains that produced a reduced number of homologs or isomers, we studied the effects of different media on the nature of the synthesis of fatty acid chains for each lipopeptide family. This study focused on two B. subtilis strains cultivated in flasks. Optimized medium for lipopeptide production and Landy medium modified by replacing glutamic acid with other alpha-amino acids were used. We found that the intensity of production of homologous compounds depends on the strain and the culture medium. Analysis of these lipopeptides by high-performance liquid chromatography showed that the strain B. subtilis NT02 yielded various homologous compounds when cultivated in Landy medium (L-Glu), but primarily one homologous product in high relative amounts when cultivated in the optimized medium. Mass spectrometric analysis and determination of the amino acid composition of this molecule enabled us to identify it as Bacillomycine L c15.},

  Abstract                 = {Anisotropic network model is used to generate a set of distinct conformations for cylophilin A (CypA). The native structure is deformed to different extents along each of the lowest-frequency modes (first 7 modes) both in negative and positive directions. Each node of the elastic network represents either a single atom in the high-resolution model or a single residue in the low-resolution model. Realistic conformations with energies close to or lower than the crystal structure and with satisfactory internal geometry are recovered by energy minimization using implicit solvation model. These conformations are then used for ensemble docking to the ligand cyclosporin A for both a further test of accuracy of generated conformers and exploration of different binding modes. Higher number of correctly docked ligands are obtained for conformations with low deformation factors as a result of lower root mean square distances with respect to crystal structure. Yet, surprisingly, the lowest binding energy is obtained for one of the highly deformed conformations as a result of its special contact with arginine side chain oriented towards binding site. Considering the fact that the cyclic ligand's backbone and protein's side chains are held rigid during docking, the conformers generated by high- and low-resolution elastic network models are almost equally successful in providing the correct binding mode. The shape of the binding pocket that incorporates crucial interaction sites for hydrogen bond formation is found to be another important determining factor for the success of the dock. Also, the small backbone variations of a few Angstroms in magnitude at the loop regions surrounding the binding pocket can cause amino acids' side chains to be displaced by magnitudes of up to 10 A and therefore have a strong influence on the efficiency of the conformational search during docking.},

  Abstract                 = {Hematopoietic malignancies have been shown to depend on cytokine growth factor autocrine/paracrine loops for growth and differentiation. This results in the constitutive activation of cytokine-mediated transcription factors like signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) 3 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma (MM). Recent evidence demonstrates that cytokines also contribute to a drug-resistant phenotype in many tumor cell types. We hypothesized that inhibitors of the STAT3 pathway would sensitize drug-resistant and endogenous cytokine-dependent NHL and MM tumor cells to the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs. We examined an AIDS-related NHL cell line, 2F7, known to be dependent on interleukin (IL)-10 for survival and an MM cell line, U266, known to be dependent on IL-6 for survival. IL-10 and IL-6 signal the cells through the activation of Janus kinase (JAK)1 and JAK2, respectively. Thus, we investigated the effect of two chemical STAT3 pathway inhibitors, namely, piceatannol (JAK1/STAT3 inhibitor) and tyrphostin AG490 (JAK2/STAT3 inhibitor), on the tumor cells for sensitization to therapeutic drugs. We demonstrate by phosphoprotein immunoblotting analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift analysis that piceatannol and AG490 inhibit the constitutive activity of STAT3 in 2F7 and U266, respectively. Furthermore, piceatannol and AG490 sensitize 2F7 and U266 cells, respectively, to apoptosis by a range of therapeutic drugs including cisplatin, fludarabine, Adriamycin, and vinblastine. The specificity of the inhibitors was corroborated in experiments showing that piceatannol had no effect on U266 and, likewise, AG490 has no effect on 2F7. The sensitization observed by these inhibitors correlated with the inhibition of Bcl-2 expression in 2F7 and Bcl-xL expression in U266. Altogether, these results demonstrate that STAT3 pathway inhibitors are a novel class of chemotherapeutic sensitizing agents capable of reversing the drug-resistant phenotype of cytokine-dependent tumor cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Proteins, including ion channels, often are described in terms of some average structure and pictured as rigid entities immersed in a featureless solvent continuum. This simplified view, which provides for a convenient representation of the protein's overall structure, incurs the risk of deemphasizing important features underlying protein function, such as thermal fluctuations in the atom positions and the discreteness of the solvent molecules. These factors become particularly important in the case of ion movement through narrow pores, where the magnitude of the thermal fluctuations may be comparable to the ion pore atom separations, such that the strength of the ion channel interactions may vary dramatically as a function of the instantaneous configuration of the ion and the surrounding protein and pore water. Descriptions of ion permeation through narrow pores, which employ static protein structures and a macroscopic continuum dielectric solvent, thus face fundamental difficulties. We illustrate this using simple model calculations based on the gramicidin A and KcsA potassium channels, which show that thermal atomic fluctuations lead to energy profiles that vary by tens of kcal/mol. Consequently, within the framework of a rigid pore model, ion-channel energetics is extremely sensitive to the choice of experimental structure and how the space-dependent dielectric constant is assigned. Given these observations, the significance of any description based on a rigid structure appears limited. Creating a conducting channel model from one single structure requires substantial and arbitrary engineering of the model parameters, making it difficult for such approaches to contribute to our understanding of ion permeation at a microscopic level.},

  Abstract                 = {Ion channels catalyze the permeation of charged molecules across cell membranes and are essential for many vital physiological functions, including nerve and muscle activity. To understand better the mechanisms underlying ion conduction and valence selectivity of narrow ion channels, we have employed free energy techniques to calculate the potential of mean force (PMF) for ion movement through the prototypical gramicidin A channel. Employing modern all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) force fields with umbrella sampling methods that incorporate one hundred 1-2 ns trajectories, we find that it is possible to achieve semi-quantitative agreement with experimental binding and conductance measurements. We also examine the sensitivity of the MD-PMF results to the choice of MD force field and compare PMFs for potassium, calcium and chloride ions to explore the basis for the valence selectivity of this narrow and uncharged ion channel. A large central barrier is observed for both anions and divalent ions, consistent with lack of experimental conductance. Neither anion or divalent cation is seen to be stabilized inside the channel relative to the bulk electrolyte and each leads to large disruptions to the protein and membrane structure when held deep inside the channel. Weak binding of calcium ions outside the channel corresponds to a free energy well that is too shallow to demonstrate channel blocking. Our findings emphasize the success of the MD-PMF approach and the sensitivity of ion energetics to the choice of biomolecular force field.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate methods for extracting the potential of mean force (PMF) governing ion permeation from molecular dynamics simulations (MD) using gramicidin A as a prototypical narrow ion channel. It is possible to obtain well-converged meaningful PMFs using all-atom MD, which predict experimental observables within order-of-magnitude agreement with experimental results. This was possible by careful attention to issues of statistical convergence of the PMF, finite size effects, and lipid hydrocarbon chain polarizability. When comparing the modern all-atom force fields of CHARMM27 and AMBER94, we found that a fairly consistent picture emerges, and that both AMBER94 and CHARMM27 predict observables that are in semiquantitative agreement with both the experimental conductance and dissociation coefficient. Even small changes in the force field, however, result in significant changes in permeation energetics. Furthermore, the full two-dimensional free-energy surface describing permeation reveals the location and magnitude of the central barrier and the location of two binding sites for K(+) ion permeation near the channel entrance--i.e., an inner site on-axis and an outer site off-axis. We conclude that the MD-PMF approach is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the function of narrow ion channels in a manner that is consistent with the atomic and thermally fluctuating nature of proteins.},

  abstract    = {We use the well-known structural and functional properties of the gramicidin A channel to test the appropriateness of force fields commonly used in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of ion channels. For this purpose, the high-resolution structure of the gramicidin A dimer is embedded in a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer, and the potential of mean force of a K(+) ion is calculated along the channel axis using the umbrella sampling method. Calculations are performed using two of the most common force fields in MD simulations: CHARMM and GROMACS. Both force fields lead to large central barriers for K(+) ion permeation, that are substantially higher than those deduced from the physiological data by inverse methods. In long MD simulations lasting over 60 ns, several ions are observed to enter the binding site but none of them crossed the channel despite the presence of a large driving field. The present results, taken together with many earlier studies, highlights the shortcomings of the standard force fields used in MD simulations of ion channels and calls for construction of more appropriate force fields for this purpose.},

  Abstract                 = {Lipid domain formation induced by annexin was investigated in mixtures of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylserine (PS), and cholesterol (Chol), which were selected to mimic the inner leaflet of a eukaryotic plasma membrane. Annexins are ubiquitous and abundant cytoplasmic, peripheral proteins, which bind to membranes containing PS in the presence of calcium ions (Ca(2+)), but whose function is unknown. Prompted by indications of interplay between the presence of cholesterol in PS/PC mixtures and the binding of annexins, we used Monte Carlo simulations to investigate protein and lipid domain formation in these mixtures. The set of interaction parameters between lipids and proteins was assigned by matching experimental observables to corresponding variables in the calculations. In the case of monounsaturated phospholipids, the PS-PC and PC-Chol interactions are weakly repulsive. The interaction between protein and PS was determined based on experiments of annexin binding to PC/PS mixtures in the presence of Ca(2+). Based on the proposal that PS and cholesterol form a complex in model membranes, a favorable PS-Chol interaction was postulated. Finally, protein-protein favorable interactions were also included, which are consistent with observations of large, two-dimensional, regular arrays of annexins on membranes. Those net interactions between pairs of lipids, proteins and lipids, and between proteins are all small, of the order of the average kinetic energy. We found that annexin a5 can induce formation of large PS domains, coincident with protein domains, but only if cholesterol is present.},

We have examined the thermodynamics and kinetics of their interaction with phospholipid vesicles, namely, binding and peptide-induced dye efflux. The thermodynamics of binding calculated using the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale are in good agreement with the values derived from experiment. The generally accepted view that binding affinity determines functional specificity is also supported by experiments in model membranes. We now propose the hypothesis that it is the thermodynamics of the insertion of the peptide into the membrane, from a surface-bound state, that determine the mechanism.},

The use of model systems has provided a wealth of information on the interactions of amphipathic peptides with membranes. Binding of peptides to membranes can be monitored by measuring FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer from a Trp residue on the peptide to a lipid fluorophore incorporated in the membrane. Especially for peptides that perturb or disrupt the membrane, it is advantageous to perform these measurements as a function of time, rather than in steady state. The activity of these amphipathic peptides toward model membranes is usually measured by dye efflux kinetics. One of those methods, based on self-quenching of carboxyfluorescein, is described here, together with a discussion of caveats and pitfalls of the corresponding analysis and interpretation.},

The unlike nearest-neighbor interaction free energies (omega(AB)) between lipids (including Chol), obtained by an variety of unrelated methods, are typically in the range of 0-400 cal/mol in absolute value. Most are positive, meaning that the interaction is unfavorable, but some are negative, meaning it is favorable. It is of special interest that favorable interactions occur mainly between ordered phospholipids and Chol.

  Abstract                 = {The concept of lipid rafts and the intense work toward their characterization in biological membranes has spurred a renewed interest in the understanding of domain formation, particularly in the case of cholesterol-containing membranes. The thermodynamic principles underlying formation of domains, rafts, or cholesterol/phospholipid complexes are reviewed here, along with recent work in model and biological membranes. A major motivation for this review was to present those concepts in a way appropriate for the broad readership that has been drawn to the field. Evidence from a number of different techniques points to the conclusion that lipid-lipid interactions are generally weak; therefore, in most cases, massive phase separations are not to be expected in membranes. On the contrary, small, dynamic lipid domains, possibly stabilized by proteins are the most likely outcome. The results on mixed lipid bilayers are used to discuss recent experiments in biological membranes. The clear indication is that proteins partition preferentially into fluid, disordered lipid domains, which is contrary to their localization in ordered, cholesterol/sphingomyelin rafts inferred from detergent extraction experiments on cell membranes. Globally, the evidence appears most consistent with a membrane model in which the majority of the lipid is in a liquid-ordered phase, with dispersed, small, liquid-disordered domains, where most proteins reside. Co-clustering of proteins and their concentration in some membrane areas may occur because of similar preferences for a particular domain but also because of simultaneous exclusion from other lipid phases. Specialized structures, such as caveolae, which contain high concentrations of cholesterol and caveolin are not necessarily similar to bulk liquid-ordered phase.},

  Abstract                 = {Sixteen single-cysteine substitution mutants of rhodopsin were prepared in the sequence 306-321 which begins in transmembrane helix VII and ends at the palmitoylation sites at 322C and 323C. The substituted cysteine residues were modified with a selective reagent to generate a nitroxide side chain, and the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of each spin-labeled mutant was analyzed in terms of residue accessibility and mobility. The periodic behavior of these parameters along the sequence indicated that residues 306-314 were in a regular alpha-helical conformation representing the end of helix VII. This helix apparently extends about 1.5 turns above the surface of the membrane, with one face in strong tertiary interaction with the core of the protein. For the segment 315-321, substituted cysteine residues at 317, 318, 320, and 321 had low reactivity with the spin-label reagent. This segment has the most extensive tertiary interactions yet observed in the rhodopsin extra-membrane sequences at the cytoplasmic surface. Previous studies showed the spontaneous formation of a disulfide bond between cysteine residues at 65 and 316. This result indicates that at least some of the tertiary contacts made in the 315-321 segment are with the sequence connecting transmembrane helices I and II. Photoactivation of rhodopsin produces changes in structure detected by spin labels at 306, 313, and 316. The changes at 313 can be accounted for by movements in the adjacent helix VI.},

  Abstract                 = {Twenty-one single-cysteine substitution mutants were prepared in the sequence 56-75 between transmembrane helices I and II at the cytoplasmic surface of bovine rhodopsin. Each mutant was reacted with a sulfhydryl-specific reagent to produce a nitroxide side chain. The electron paramagnetic resonance of the labeled proteins in dodecyl maltoside solution was analyzed to provide the relative mobility and accessibility of the nitroxide side chain to both polar and nonpolar paramagnetic reagents. The results indicate that the hydrophobic-water interface of the micelle intersects helices I and II near residues 64 and 71, respectively. Thus, the sequence 64-71 is in the aqueous phase, while 56-63 and 72-75 lie in the transmembrane helices I and II, respectively. The lipid-facing surfaces on transmembrane helices I and II near the cytoplasmic surface correspond to approximately 180 degrees and 90 degrees of arc on the helical surfaces, respectively. Photoactivation of rhodopsin produced changes in structure in the region investigated, primarily around helix II. However, these changes are much smaller than those noted by spin labels in helix VI (Altenbach, C., Yang, K., Farrens, D., Farahbakhsh, Z., Khorana, H. G., and Hubbell, W. L.

  abstract             = {Site-directed spin labeling has qualitatively shown that a key event during activation of rhodopsin is a rigid-body movement of transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) at the cytoplasmic surface of the molecule. To place this result on a quantitative footing, and to identify movements of other helices upon photoactivation, double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy was used to determine distances and distance changes between pairs of nitroxide side chains introduced in helices at the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin. Sixteen pairs were selected from a set of nine individual sites, each located on the solvent exposed surface of the protein where structural perturbation due to the presence of the label is minimized. Importantly, the EPR spectra of the labeled proteins change little or not at all upon photoactivation, suggesting that rigid-body motions of helices rather than rearrangement of the nitroxide side chains are responsible for observed distance changes. For inactive rhodopsin, it was possible to find a globally minimized arrangement of nitroxide locations that simultaneously satisfied the crystal structure of rhodopsin (Protein Data Bank entry 1GZM), the experimentally measured distance data, and the known rotamers of the nitroxide side chain. A similar analysis of the data for activated rhodopsin yielded a new geometry consistent with a 5-A outward movement of TM6 and smaller movements involving TM1, TM7, and the C-terminal sequence following helix H8. The positions of nitroxides in other helices at the cytoplasmic surface remained largely unchanged. 10.1073/pnas.0802515105},

  Abstract                 = {Thirty consecutive single cysteine substitution mutants in the amino acids Q225-I256 of bovine rhodopsin have been prepared and modified with a sulfhydryl specific nitroxide reagent. This sequence includes the E-F interhelical loop, a transducin interaction site. The accessibilities of the attached nitroxides to collisions with hydrophilic and hydrophobic paramagnetic probes in solution were determined, and the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra analyzed in terms of side chain mobility, both in the dark and after photoactivation. Accessibility cata shows that the rhodopsin polypeptide chain crosses an aqueous/ hydrophobic boundary in the range V227-K231 and again in the range V250-V254. In the hydrophobic segments, both the accessibility and mobility data are consistent with helical structures. In the regions of the sequence located within the aqueous phase, periodic variation in both accessibility and mobility of the spin-labeled side chains indicates that the E-F interhelical loop is largely alpha-helical, being formed by regular extensions of the E and F helices by about 1.5 and 3 turns, respectively. Judging from nitroxide mobilities, the putative extension of helix E in the aqueous phase is more dynamic than that of helix F. Changes in the electron paramagnetic resonance characteristics of the spin-labeled rhodopsin upon photoactivation indicate that chromophore isomerization results in patterns of structural changes that can be interpreted in terms of movements of helices that extend into the aqueous loop regions.},

  Abstract                 = {It has recently been suggested by Mu et al. [Proteins 58, 45 (2005)] to use backbone dihedral angles instead of Cartesian coordinates in a principal component analysis of molecular dynamics simulations. Dihedral angles may be advantageous because internal coordinates naturally provide a correct separation of internal and overall motion, which was found to be essential for the construction and interpretation of the free energy landscape of a biomolecule undergoing large structural rearrangements. To account for the circular statistics of angular variables, a transformation from the space of dihedral angles {phi(n)} to the metric coordinate space {x(n)=cos phi(n),y(n)=sin phi(n)} was employed. To study the validity and the applicability of the approach, in this work the theoretical foundations underlying the dihedral angle principal component analysis (dPCA) are discussed. It is shown that the dPCA amounts to a one-to-one representation of the original angle distribution and that its principal components can readily be characterized by the corresponding conformational changes of the peptide. Furthermore, a complex version of the dPCA is introduced, in which N angular variables naturally lead to N eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Applying the methodology to the construction of the free energy landscape of decaalanine from a 300 ns molecular dynamics simulation, a critical comparison of the various methods is given.},

  Abstract                 = {A systematic approach to construct a low-dimensional free energy landscape from a classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is presented. The approach is based on the recently proposed dihedral angle principal component analysis (dPCA), which avoids artifacts due to the mixing of internal and overall motions in Cartesian coordinates and circumvents problems associated with the circularity of angular variables. Requiring that the energy landscape reproduces the correct number, energy, and location of the system's metastable states and barriers, the dimensionality of the free energy landscape (i.e., the number of essential components) is obtained. This dimensionality can be determined from the distribution and autocorrelation of the principal components. By performing an 800 ns MD simulation of the folding of hepta-alanine in explicit water and using geometric and kinetic clustering techniques, it is shown that a five-dimensional dPCA energy landscape is a suitable and accurate representation of the full-dimensional landscape. In the second step, the dPCA energy landscape can be employed (e.g., in a Langevin simulation) to facilitate a detailed investigation of biomolecular dynamics in low dimensions. Finally, several ways to visualize the multidimensional energy landscape are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Flash photolysis studies have shown that the membrane lipid environment strongly influences the ability of rhodopsin to form the key metarhodopsin II intermediate. Here we have used plasmon-waveguide resonance (PWR) spectroscopy, an optical method sensitive to both mass and conformation, to probe the effects of lipid composition on conformational changes of rhodopsin induced by light and due to binding and activation of transducin (G(t)). Octylglucoside-solubilized rhodopsin was incorporated by detergent dilution into solid-supported bilayers composed either of egg phosphatidylcholine or various mixtures of a nonlamellar-forming lipid (dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine; DOPE) together with a lamellar-forming lipid (dioleoylphosphatidylcholine; DOPC). Light-induced proteolipid conformational changes as a function of pH correlated well with previous flash photolysis studies, indicating that the PWR spectral shifts monitored metarhodopsin II formation. The magnitude of these effects, and hence the extent of the conformational transition, was found to be proportional to the DOPE content. Our data are consistent with previous suggestions that lipids having a negative spontaneous curvature favor elongation of rhodopsin during the activation process. In addition, measurements of the G(t)/rhodopsin interaction in a DOPC/DOPE (25:75) bilayer at pH 5 demonstrated that light activation increased the affinity for G(t) from 64 nM to 0.7 nM, whereas G(t) affinity for dark-adapted rhodopsin was unchanged. By contrast, in DOPC bilayers the affinity of G(t) for light-activated rhodopsin was only 18 nM at pH 5. Moreover exchange of GDP for GTP gamma S was also monitored by PWR spectroscopy. Only the light-activated receptor was able to induce this exchange which was unaffected by DOPE incorporation.

  Abstract                 = {The lipid bilayer component of biological membranes is important for the distribution, organization, and function of bilayer-spanning proteins. This regulation is due to both specific lipid-protein interactions and general bilayer-protein interactions, which modulate the energetics and kinetics of protein conformational transitions, as well as the protein distribution between different membrane compartments. The bilayer regulation of membrane protein function arises from the hydrophobic coupling between the protein's hydrophobic domains and the bilayer hydrophobic core, which causes protein conformational changes that involve the protein/bilayer boundary to perturb the adjacent bilayer. Such bilayer perturbations, or deformations, incur an energetic cost, which for a given conformational change varies as a function of the bilayer material properties (bilayer thickness, intrinsic lipid curvature, and the elastic compression and bending moduli). Protein function therefore is regulated by changes in bilayer material properties, which determine the free-energy changes caused by the protein-induced bilayer deformation. The lipid bilayer thus becomes an allosteric regulator of membrane function.},

The interaction of the lactoferricin-derived peptide LF11 and its N-terminally acylated analogue, lauryl-LF11, with different chemotypes of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS Re, Ra and smooth S form) was investigated by biophysical means and was related to the peptides' biological activities. Both peptides exhibit high antibacterial activity against the three strains of Salmonella enterica differing in the LPS chemotype. Lauryl-LF11 has one order of magnitude higher activity against Re-type, but activity against Ra- and S-type bacteria is comparable with that of LF11. The alkyl derivative peptide lauryl-LF11 shows a much stronger inhibition of the LPS-induced cytokine induction in human mononuclear cells than LF11. Although peptide-LPS interaction is essentially of electrostatic nature, the lauryl-modified peptide displays a strong hydrophobic component. Such a feature might then explain the fact that saturation of the peptide binding takes place at a much lower peptide/LPS ratio for LF11 than for lauryl-LF11, and that an overcompensation of the negative LPS backbone charges is observed for lauryl-LF11. The influence of LF11 on the gel-to-liquid-crystalline phase-transition of LPS is negligible for LPS Re, but clearly fluidizing for LPS Ra. In contrast, lauryl-LF11 causes a cholesterol-like effect in the two chemotypes, fluidizing in the gel and rigidifying of the hydrocarbon chains in the liquid-crystalline phase. Both peptides convert the mixed unilamellar/non-lamellar aggregate structure of lipid A, the 'endotoxic principle' of LPS, into a multilamellar one. These data contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of the peptide-mediated neutralization of endotoxin and effect of lipid modification of peptides.},

  annotation = {A systematic investigation of the kinetics of the electrochemical reduction of a series of 11 arylmethyl halides in acetonitrile and N,N'-dimethylformamide reveals a striking change in the reductive cleavage mechanism as a function of the energy of the pi* orbital liable to accept the incoming electron. With ring-substituted nitrobenzyl chlorides and bromides, a stepwise mechanism involving the intermediacy of the anion radical takes place. When slightly less electron- withdrawing substituents, such as nitrile or ester groups, are involved, the reaction occurs via a concerted electron transfer-bond breaking mechanism. This is also observed with the unsubstituted benzyl chloride and bromide as well as with 9-anthracenylmethyl chloride. The main factor then governing the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reductive cleavage is then the dissociation energy of the bond being broken. There is an excellent agreement between the predictions of the recently developed model of dissociative electron transfer and the experimental data both in terms of the quadratic character of the activation-driving force relationship and the magnitude of the intrinsic barrier. In this connection, procedures utilizing the difference in cyclic voltammetric peak potential between two compounds bearing the same nucleofugal group to estimate the difference in their bond dissociation energies are discussed.},

  annotation = {Dissociative electron transfers in condensed phases occur in two steps. The fragments are first formed within a. solvent cage from which they further diffuse. The formation of caged, rather than free moving, fragments is taken into account in an improved version of the dissociative electron transfer theory where entropic aspects are emphasized. A more detailed treatment than previously available of the fragmentation and solvent reorganization factors is given in terms of both energies and free energies. The reason that the bond dissociation energy, rather than the bond dissociation free energy, represents the contribution of fragmentation to the intrinsic barrier ensues. The resulting equations that relate the activation free enthalpy and entropy, as well as the symmetry factor, to the standard free enthalpy and entropy of the reaction are given for electrochemical, bimolecular, and intramolecular reactions. Solvation radii change upon electron transfer triggered bond cleavage. An iterative procedure is proposed for adapting the estimation of the solvent reorganization factor to the ensuing coupling of the fragmentation and solvent reorganization coordinates. Experimental examples illustrating applications of the theory are discussed.},

We report a series of long (up to 150 ns) MD simulations of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers in which the methodology of simulation is systematically varied. Comparisons of simulations with truncation schemes, Ewald summations, and modified Coulomb interactions, either by shift functions or reaction field models, to describe long-range electrostatics point out the artifacts inherent in each of these methods and above all those of straight cutoff methods. We further show that bilayer properties are less sensitive to the details of the pressure-coupling algorithm and that an increased integration time step of 5 fs can be safely used in simulations of phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers.},

The availability of high-resolution crystal structures of five prototypical GPCRs, bovine and squid rhodopsin, engineered A(2A)-adenosine, beta(1)- and beta(2)-adrenergic receptors, permits comparative analysis of features common to these and likely all GPCRs. We provide an analysis of the distribution of water molecules in the transmembrane region of these GPCR structures and find conserved contacts with microdomains demonstrated to be involved in receptor activation. Colocalization of water molecules associating with highly conserved and functionally important residues in several of these GPCR crystal structures supports the notion that these waters are likely to be as important to proper receptor function as the conserved residues. Moreover, in the absence of large conformational changes in rhodopsin after photoactivation, we propose that ordered waters contribute to the functional plasticity needed to transmit activation signals from the retinal-binding pocket to the cytoplasmic face of rhodopsin and that fundamental features of the mechanism of activation, involving these conserved waters, are shared by many if not all family A receptors.},

In the case of allosteric activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), water likely imparts structural plasticity required for agonist-induced signal transmission. Inspection of structures of GPCR superfamily members reveals the presence of conserved embedded water molecules likely important to GPCR function. Coupling radiolytic hydroxyl radical labeling with rapid H2O18 solvent mixing, we observed no exchange of these structural waters with bulk solvent in either ground state or for the Meta II or opsin states. However, the radiolysis approach permitted labeling of selected side chain residues within the transmembrane helices and revealed activation-induced changes in local structural constraints likely mediated by dynamics of both water and protein. These results suggest both a possible general mechanism for water-dependent communication in family A GPCRs based on structural conservation, and a strategy for probing membrane protein structure.},

The radical cations of these compounds were generated by photosensitization (electron transfer) using 1,4-dicyanobenzene (3) as the electron acceptor. The three reactions studied were: (1) The addition of nucleophiles (methanol) to the radical cation of the arylalkenes, a reaction that yields the anti-Markovnikov addition product. (2) The carbon-carbon bond cleavage of radical cations, which yields products derived from the radical and carbocation fragments. (3) The deprotonation of the radical cation, a reaction that can be used to invert the configuration at a saturated carbon centre. The mechanisms of these reactions are discussed and the factors that need to be considered in order to predict reactivity are defined. Molecular orbital calculations (UHF/STO-3G) were carried out on the radical cations of the model compounds 3- and 4- vinylanisole and 3- and 4-methylanisole.},

Advantages of these AMPs include high activity in slightly acidic areas of the human body and relatively low toxicity in other areas. Also, many AMPs are highly active in a multivalent form, but this often increases toxicity. Here we designed pH dependent amphiphilic compounds consisting of multiple ultrashort histidine lipopeptides on a triazacyclophane scaffold, which showed high activity toward Aspergillus fumigatus and Cryptococcus neoformans at acidic pH, yet remained nontoxic. In vivo, treatment with a myristic acid conjugated trivalent histidine-histidine dipeptide resulted in 55\% survival of mice (n = 9) in an otherwise lethal murine lung Aspergillus infection model. Fungal burden was assessed and showed completely sterile lungs in 80\% of the mice (n = 5). At pH 5.5 and 7.5, differing peptide-membrane interactions and peptide nanostructures were observed. This study underscores the potential of unique AMPs to become the next generation of clinical antimicrobial therapy.},

  Abstract                 = {Many natural broad-spectrum cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) possess a general mode of action that is dependent on lipophilicity and charge. Modulating the lipophilicity of AMPs by the addition of a fatty acid has been an effective strategy to increase the lytic activity and can further broaden the spectrum of AMPs. However, lipophilic modifications that narrow the spectrum of activity and exclusively direct peptides to fungi are less common. Here, we show that short peptide sequences can be targeted to fungi with structured lipophilic biomolecules, such as vitamin E and cholesterol. The conjugates were active against Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Candida albicans but not against bacteria and were observed to cause membrane perturbation by transmission electron microscopy and in membrane permeability studies. However, for C. albicans, selected compounds were effective without the perturbation of the cell membrane, and synergism was seen with a vitamin E conjugate and amphotericin B. Moreover, in combination with Î²-cyclodextrin, antibacterial activity emerged in selected compounds. Biocompatibility for selected active compounds was tested in vitro and in vivo using toxicity assays on erythrocytes, macrophages, and mice. In vitro cytotoxicity experiments led to selective toxicity ratios (50\% lethal concentration/MIC) of up to 64 for highly active antifungal compounds, and no in vivo murine toxicity was seen. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of the conjugated lipophilic structure and suggest that the modulation of other biologically relevant peptides with hydrophobic moieties, such as cholesterol and vitamin E, generate compounds with unique bioactivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Antimicrobial peptides attract a lot of interest as potential candidates to overcome bacterial resistance. So far, nearly all the proposed scenarios for their mechanism of action are associated with perforating and breaking down bacterial membranes after a binding process. In this study we obtained additional information on peptide induced demixing of bacterial membranes as a possible mechanism of specificity of antimicrobial peptides. We used DSC and FT-IR to study the influence of a linear and cyclic arginine- and tryptophan-rich antimicrobial peptide having the same sequence (RRWWRF) on the thermotropic phase transitions of lipid membranes. The cyclization of the peptide was found to enhance its antimicrobial activity and selectivity ( Dathe, M. Nikolenko, H. Klose, J. Bienert, M. Biochemistry 43 (2004) 9140-9150). A particular preference of the binding of the peptides to DPPG headgroups compared to other headgroups of negatively charged phospholipids, namely DMPA, DPPS and cardiolipin was observed. The main transition temperature of DPPG bilayers was considerably decreased by the bound peptides. The peptides caused a substantial down-shift of the transition of DPPG/DMPC. In contrast, they induced a demixing in DPPG/DPPE bilayers and led to the appearance of two peaks in the DSC curves indicating a DPPG-peptide-enriched domain and a DPPE-enriched domain. These results could be confirmed by FT-IR-spectroscopic measurements. We therefore propose that the observed peptide-induced lipid demixing in PG/PE-membranes could be a further specific effect of the antimicrobial peptides operating only on bacterial membranes, which contain appreciable amounts of PE and PG, and which could in principle also occur in liquid-crystalline membranes.},

  Abstract                 = {The authors applied in vitro models of controlled damage to human epidermal keratinocytes (HEKs), human skin fibroblasts (HSFs), and human breast skin tissue (HBST) to examine the mechanism responsible for sulfur mustard (HD)-induced interleukin-6 (IL-6) alterations. Treatment with 100 microM HD for 24 hours resulted in a significant increased amount of IL-6 being secreted by HEKs (HD-exposed to control ratio [E/C] = 4.15 +/- 0.07) and by HSFs (E/C = 7.66 +/- 0.04). Furthermore, the HD-induced secretion of IL-6 in HEKs was neutralized with monoclonal human IL-6 antibodies. The secretion of IL-6 in HBST supernatant exposed to HD produced conflicting results. Although an increase of IL-6 was observed in control superfusion media from HBST, IL-6 levels were observed to decrease as the concentration of HD increased. Time course of IL-6 mRNA levels were performed using a competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and human IL-6 mRNA assay detection kit in control and HD (100 microM)-treated HEKs cells. IL-6 mRNA transcripts in HD-exposed HEKs were first observed within 2 hours, dropped at 5 to 6 hours, and increased by approximately 2.2-fold and 8.5-fold at 24 to 48 hours after HD exposure, respectively, as detected by the Xplore mRNA Quantification System. Surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometry was also applied to study the secretion pattern of IL-6 on lysate preparations of HBST. A peak in the area of 23,194 to 23,226 Da was detected using antibody coupled to the chip. This peak was assigned to correspond to the mass of the IL-6 glycoprotein. Recombinant human IL-6 (rhIL-6) exposed to HD lacked the second disulfide bridge and was partially unfolded, as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance-nuclear Overhauser enhancement and exchange spectroscopy (NMR-NOESY). The disappearance of the resonance peak at 3.54 ppm and the appearance of a new chemical shift at 1.85 ppm suggested that a change in structure had occurred in the presence of HD. From the data, the possibility cannot be excluded that IL-6 might be involved in the early event of structural changes of the signal transducer glycoprotein that indirectly initiates the cascade of events such as skin irritation and blister formation observed in the pathophysiology of HD injury.},

They were purified from the pool of polyclonal rabbit antibodies to GAPDH with the use of immobilized GAPDH cross-linked by glutaraldehyde as an affinity sorbent. Such antibodies were capable of interacting with the native enzyme, inducing its time-dependent inactivation; the effect was different with the apo- and holoenzyme forms. Differential scanning calorimetry of the purified [GAPDH].[antibody] complex revealed a large shift of the temperature corresponding to the maximal heat capacity of the holoenzyme towards the lower temperature. Again, the effect appeared to be different with the apoenzyme. Together, the results are consistent with the hypothesis that a specific antibody is able to exercise a certain strain on the target protein, altering its conformation toward the structure of the species which served to select the antibody. The possibility of preparing selective enzyme inhibitors based on the antibodies specific to inactive enzyme conformations is considered.},

This scalar model simply investigates the magnitudes of motion of individual residues in the structure. To use the elastic model approach further for developing the details of protein mechanisms, it becomes essential to expand this model to include the added details of the directions of individual residue fluctuations. In this paper a new tool is presented for this purpose and applied to the retinol-binding protein, which indicates enhanced flexibility in the region of entry to the ligand binding site and for the portion of the protein binding to its carrier protein.},

  Abstract                 = {A protein structure is represented as a network of residues whereby edges are determined by intramolecular contacts. We introduce inhomogeneity into these networks by assigning each edge a weight that is determined by amino acid pair potentials. Two methodologies are utilized to calculate the average path lengths (APLs) between pairs: to minimize i), the maximum weight in the strong APL, and ii), the total weight in the weak APL. We systematically screen edges that have higher than a cutoff potential and calculate the shortest APLs in these reduced networks, while keeping chain connectivity. Therefore, perturbations introduced at a selected region of the residue network propagate to remote regions only along the nonscreened edges that retain their ability to disseminate the perturbation. The shortest APLs computed from the reduced homogeneous networks with only the strongest few nonbonded pairs closely reproduce the strong APLs from the weighted networks. The rate of change in the APL in the reduced residue network as compared to its randomly connected counterpart remains constant until a lower bound. Upon further link removal, this property shows an abrupt increase toward a random coil behavior. Under different perturbation scenarios, diverse optimal paths emerge for robust residue communication.},

  Abstract                 = {We study apo and holo forms of the bacterial ferric binding protein (FBP) which exhibits the so-called ferric transport dilemma: it uptakes iron from the host with remarkable affinity, yet releases it with ease in the cytoplasm for subsequent use. The observations fit the "conformational selection" model whereby the existence of a weakly populated, higher energy conformation that is stabilized in the presence of the ligand is proposed. We introduce a new tool that we term perturbation-response scanning (PRS) for the analysis of remote control strategies utilized. The approach relies on the systematic use of computational perturbation/response techniques based on linear response theory, by sequentially applying directed forces on single-residues along the chain and recording the resulting relative changes in the residue coordinates. We further obtain closed-form expressions for the magnitude and the directionality of the response. Using PRS, we study the ligand release mechanisms of FBP and support the findings by molecular dynamics simulations. We find that the residue-by-residue displacements between the apo and the holo forms, as determined from the X-ray structures, are faithfully reproduced by perturbations applied on the majority of the residues of the apo form. However, once the stabilizing ligand (Fe) is integrated to the system in holo FBP, perturbing only a few select residues successfully reproduces the experimental displacements. Thus, iron uptake by FBP is a favored process in the fluctuating environment of the protein, whereas iron release is controlled by mechanisms including chelation and allostery. The directional analysis that we implement in the PRS methodology implicates the latter mechanism by leading to a few distant, charged, and exposed loop residues. Upon perturbing these, irrespective of the direction of the operating forces, we find that the cap residues involved in iron release are made to operate coherently, facilitating release of the ion.},

  Abstract                 = {The dynamics of a folded protein is studied in water and glycerol at a series of temperatures below and above their respective dynamical transition. The system is modeled in two distinct states whereby the protein is decoupled from the bulk solvent at low temperatures, and communicates with it through a vicinal layer at physiological temperatures. A linear viscoelastic model elucidates the less-than-expected increase in the relaxation times observed in the backbone dynamics of the protein. The model further explains the increase in the flexibility of the protein once the transition takes place and the differences in the flexibility under the different solvent environments. Coupling between the vicinal layer and the protein fluctuations is necessary to interpret these observations. The vicinal layer is postulated to form once a threshold for the volumetric fluctuations in the protein to accommodate solvents of different sizes is reached. Compensation of entropic-energetic contributions from the protein-coupled vicinal layer quantifies the scaling of the dynamical transition temperatures in various solvents. The protein adapts different conformational routes for organizing the required coupling to a specific solvent, which is achieved by adjusting the amount of conformational jumps in the surface-group dihedrals.},

  Abstract                 = {The initial stages leading to the binding and functioning of membrane-active polypeptides including hormones, signal sequences, and lytic peptides are mainly governed by electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic partitioning between water and lipid bilayers. Antimicrobial peptides serve as an important model for studying the details of these initial steps. However, a systematic analysis of the contribution of multiple hydrophobic amino acids to these steps have been hindered by the propensity of many peptides to aggregate and become inactivated in solution. To this end, we synthesized a series of model amphipathic all L-amino acid peptides and their diastereomers with the sequence KX(3)KWX(2)KX(2)K, where X = Gly, Ala, Val, Ile, or Leu. The effect of the aliphatic amino acids on the biological activity, binding, structure, membrane localization, and mode of action of these peptides was investigated. Most of the L-amino acid peptides oligomerized and adopted distinct structures in solution and in a membrane mimetic environment. Among this group only the Leu containing peptide was hemolytic and highly active on most bacteria tested. The Val- and Leu-containing peptides were hemolytic but inactive toward most bacteria tested. In contrast, the diastereomeric peptides were monomeric and unstructured in solution, but they adopted distinct structures upon membrane binding. While hemolytic activity was drastically reduced, the spectrum of antibacterial activity was preserved or increased. Importantly, we found a direct correlation with the diastereomers between hydrophobicity and propensity to form a helical/distorted-helix and activity (induced membrane leakage and antibacterial activity), despite the fact that they contained 30\% D-amino acids. Furthermore, efficient increase in membrane permeability can proceed through different mechanisms. Specifically, the Leu-containing diastereomeric peptide micellized vesicles and possibly bacterial membranes while the Ile-containing diastereomeric peptide fused model membranes and irregularly disrupted bacterial membranes.},

  Abstract                 = {Our basic understanding of how to combat fungal infections has not kept pace with the recent sharp rise in life-threatening cases found particularly among immuno-compromised individuals. Current investigations for new potential antifungal agents have focused on antimicrobial peptides, which are used as a cell-free defense mechanism in all organisms. Unfortunately, despite their high antibacterial activity, most of them are not active toward fungi, the reason of which is not clear. Here, we present a new approach to modify an antibacterial peptide, a magainin analogue, to display antifungal activity by its conjugation with lipophilic acids. This approach has the advantage of producing well-defined changes in hydrophobicity, secondary structure, and self-association. These modifications were characterized in solution at physiological concentrations using CD spectroscopy, tryptophan fluorescence, and analytical ultracentrifugation. In order of increasing hydrophobicity, the attachment to the magainin-2 analogue of (i) heptanoic acid results in a monomeric, unordered structure, (ii) undecanoic acid yields concentration-dependent oligomers of alpha helices, and (iii) palmitic acid yields concentration-independent alpha-helical monomers, a novel lipopeptide structure, which is resistant to proteolytic digestion. Membrane-lipopeptide interactions and the membrane-bound structures were studied using fluorescence and ATR-FTIR in PC/PE/PI/ergosterol (5/2.5/2.5/1, w/w) SUV, which constitute the major components of Candida albicans bilayers. A direct correlation was found between oligomerization of the lipopeptides in solution and potent antifungal activity. These results provide insight to a new approach of modulating hydrophobicity and self-assembly of antimicrobial peptides in solution, without altering the sequence of the peptidic chain. These studies also provide a general means of developing a new group of lipopeptide candidates as therapeutic agents against fungal infections.},

The bulk modulus and other microscopically determined parameters are passed to a continuum-level model operating in time- and length-scales orders of magnitude beyond that which is accessible by atomistic-level simulation. The continuum-level simulation method used is the material point method (MPM), and the particular variation used here takes advantage of the spherical nature of many GUVs. An osmotic pressure gradient due to a solvent concentration change is incorporated into the continuum-level simulation, resulting in osmotic swelling of the vesicle. The model is then extended to treat mixtures of DMPC and cholesterol, where small domains of different composition are considered.},

Key material properties obtained from detailed atomistic-level simulations are used to parameterize the meso-scale model. The fundamental length and time scale of the meso-scale simulation are at least an order of magnitude beyond that used at the atomistic level. Dissipative particle dynamics cast in a new membrane formulation provides the simulation methodology. A meso-scale representation of a dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine membrane is examined in the high and low surface tension regimes. At high surface tensions, the calculated modulus is found to be slightly less than the atomistically determined value. This result agrees with the theoretical prediction that high-strain thermal undulations still persist, which have the effect of reducing the value of the atomistically determined modulus. Zero surface tension simulations indicate the presence of strong thermal undulatory modes, whereas the undulation spectrum and the calculated bending modulus are in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions and experiment.},

Smooth particle applied mechanics, a form of smoothed particle continuum mechanics, is used to solve either the time-dependent Landau-Ginzburg or Cahn-Hilliard free-energy models for the composition dynamics. At the same time, the underlying elastic membrane is modeled using smooth particle applied mechanics, resulting in a unified computational scheme capable of treating the response of the composition fields to arbitrary deformations of the vesicle and vice versa. The results indicate that curvature coupling, along with the field theory model for composition free energy, gives domain formations that are correlated with surface defects on the vesicle. In the case that external deformations are included, the domain structures are seen to respond to such deformations. The present simulation capability provides a significant step forward toward the simulation of realistic cellular membrane processes.},

Two different explicit mesoscopic solvent models are employed. The first mesoscopic solvent is denoted the big liquid oscillating blob system, which is parametrized to model water at a coarse-grained level and is motivated by a Langevin-like approach; the resulting membrane dynamics predict a solvent viscosity dependence consistent with the known viscosity of water. The second mesoscopic solvent is a Weeks-Chandler-Anderson model. Here, it is found that the correct mesoscopic hydrodynamic scaling of the membrane undulation dynamics is still preserved, although accelerated. When the behavior of the two membranes in close proximity to one another is examined, very little correlated motion is observed. However, the theoretically predicted scaling of the entropic undulation energy is confirmed, demonstrating that the entropic interaction between two membranes becomes increasingly repulsive with decreasing separation.},

Recent experiments provided valuable data on the free energy changes associated with the transfer of individual amino acids from water to membrane. However, a complete picture of the pathways and the associated changes in energy of peptide insertion into a membrane remains elusive. To this end, computational techniques supplement the experimental data with atomic-level details and shed light on the energetics of insertion. Here, we employed the technique of umbrella sampling in a total 850 ns of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to study the free energy profile and the pathway of insertion of a model hexapeptide consisting of a tryptophan and five leucines (WL5). The computed free energy profile of the peptide as it travels from bulk solvent through the membrane core exhibits two minima: a local minimum at the watermembrane interface or the headgroup region and a global minimum at the hydrophobichydrophilic interface close to the lipid glycerol region. A rather small barrier of roughly 1 kcal mol1 exists at the membrane core, which is explained by the enhanced flexibility of the peptide when deeply inserted. Combining our results with those in the literature, we present a thermodynamic model for peptide insertion and aggregation which involves peptide aggregation upon contact with the membrane at the solventlipid headgroup interface.},

A comparison of the two methods shows that continuum dielectric theory can successfully encapsulate the nonlinear solvent responses around the solute if the dielectric boundary is defined by 1/2(R-atom,R-i + R-gmax,R-i), where R-atom,R-i is the atomic radius of solute atom i, and R-gmax,R-i is the first peak position of the solute atom-solvent atom radial number/charge density distribution function. Furthermore, continuum dielectric theory in conjunction with the two-sphere description of the dielectric boundary can reproduce simultaneously the electrostatic solvation free energies, as well as the solvent-induced electrostatic potentials and field components at the solute sites derived from simulations in the presence of explicit solvent.},

  Abstract                 = {A low-resolution model is used together with recently developed knowledge-based potentials for exploring the dynamics of proteins. Configurations are generated using a Monte Carlo/Metropolis scheme combined with a singular value decomposition technique (SVD). The approach is shown to characterize the cooperative motions in good detail, at least 1 order of magnitude faster than atomic simulations. Trajectories are partitioned into modes, and the slowest ones are analyzed to elucidate the dominant mechanism of collective motions. Calculations performed for bacteriophage T4 lysozyme, a two-domain enzyme, demonstrate that the structural elements within each domain are subject to strongly coupled motions, whereas the motions of the two domains with respect to each other are strongly anticorrelated. This type of motion, evidenced by the synchronous fluctuations of the domain centroids by up to +/-4.0 A in opposite directions, is comparable to the movements observed by recent spin-labeling experiments in solution. The potential of mean force governing these fluctuations is shown to be anharmonic. The beta-sheet region at the N-terminal domain and the helix E in the C-terminal domain are identified as regions important for mediating cooperative motions and, in particular, for the opening and closing of the active-site cleft between the domains. Residues Leu66-Phe67 in the central helix C stop the propagation of correlated motions between the domains. There is a correlation between the groups involved in highly cooperative motions revealed by simulations and the highly protected regions during unfolding measured by pulsed H/D exchange and 2-D NMR.},

  Abstract                 = {Electrostatic forces, acting between helices and modulated by the presence of the ion atmosphere, are key determinants in the energetic balance that governs RNA folding. Previous studies have employed Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) theory to compute the energetic contribution of these forces in RNA folding. However, the complex interaction of these electrostatic forces with RNA features such as tertiary contact formation, specific ion-binding, and complex interhelical junctions present in prior studies precluded a rigorous evaluation of PB theory, especially in physiologically important Mg(2+) solutions. To critically assess PB theory, we developed a model system that isolates these electrostatic forces. The model system, composed of two DNA duplexes tethered by a polyethylene glycol junction, is an analog for the unfolded state of canonical helix-junction-helix motifs found in virtually all structured RNAs. This model system lacks the complicating features that have precluded a critical assessment of PB in prior studies, ensuring that interhelical electrostatic forces dominate the behavior of the system. The system's simplicity allows PB predictions to be directly compared with small-angle X-ray scattering experiments over a range of monovalent and divalent ion concentrations. These comparisons indicate that PB is a reasonable description of the underlying electrostatic energies for monovalent ions, but large deviations are observed for divalent ions. The validation of PB for monovalent solutions allows analysis of the change in the conformational ensemble of this simple motif as salt concentration is changed. Addition of ions allows the motif to sample more compact microstates, increasing its conformational entropy. The increase of conformational entropy presents an additional barrier to folding by stabilizing the unfolded state. Neglecting this effect will adversely impact the accuracy of folding analyses and models.},

  Abstract                 = {Linear helical channel-forming peptides structurally similar to the Xenopus-derived antibiotic, Magainin2-amide, were synthesized. Because activity resides in the physicochemical properties of the peptides, an all-D-amino acid as well as an all-L-amino acid sequence were tested for anticancer activity. In vitro activity against carcinoma cells and in vivo efficacy against four murine ascites tumors were determined. The novel peptides proved to have enhanced potency in vitro and in vivo as compared to the parent compound. The 50\% inhibitory concentrations against A549 cells for the all-D, the all-L, and Magainin2 were 6, 10, and 110 micrograms/ml, respectively. All three peptides had activity against P388 leukemia, S180 ascites, and a spontaneous ovarian tumor when injected i.p. Increase in life span of over 100\% was produced for the analogues in the latter two models. The maximally effective concentrations for the analogues were 20 to 25 mg/kg while Magainin2 required 50-60 mg/kg for in vivo efficacy. The all-D-amino acid peptide, MSI-238, proved as effective as doxorubicin at a more advanced stage of the ovarian tumor and this activity may be attributed to its resistance to proteolytic degradation. Therefore, this class of amphiphilic alpha-helical cationic peptides has potential in the peritoneal treatment of ovarian cancer.},

We describe a theoretical model for allosteric regulation in receptors that addresses a fundamental riddle of signaling: What are the structural origins of the receptor agonism (specific signaling response to ligand binding)? The model suggests that different signaling pathways in bovine rhodopsin or human ÃÂ²-adrenergic receptor can be mediated by specific structural motions in the receptors. We discuss implications for understanding the receptor agonism, particularly the recently observed Ã¢ÂÂ biased agonismÃ¢ÂÂ (selected activation of specific signaling pathways), and for developing rational structure-based drug-design strategies.},

  Abstract                 = {Monotopic membrane proteins bind tightly to cell membranes but do not generally span the lipid bilayer. Their interactions with lipid bilayers may be studied via coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations. Understanding such interactions is important as monotopic enzymes frequently act on hydrophobic substrates, whilst X-ray structures rarely provide direct information on their interactions with membranes. CG-MD self-assembly simulations enable prediction of the orientation and depth of insertion into a lipid bilayer of a monotopic protein, and also of the interactions of individual protein residues with lipid molecules. The CG-MD method has been evaluated via comparison with extended (>30 ns) atomistic simulations of monoamine oxidase, revealing good agreement between the results of coarse-grained and atomistic simulations. CG-MD simulations have been applied to a set of 11 monotopic proteins for which three dimensional structures are available. These proteins may be divided into two groups on the basis of the results of the simulations. One group consists of those proteins which are inserted into the lipid bilayer to a limited extent, interacting mainly at the phospholipid/water interface. The second group consists of those which are inserted more deeply into the bilayer. Those monotopic proteins which are inserted more deeply cause significant local perturbation of bilayer properties such as bilayer thickness. Deeper insertion seems to correlate with a greater number of basic residues in the ?foot? whereby a monotopic protein interacts with the membrane.},

  abstract    = {We have constructed a mixed dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol bilayer (DOPG) bilayer utilizing MD simulations. The aim was to develop an explicit molecular model of biological membranes as a complementary technique to neutron diffraction studies that are well established within the group. A monolayer was constructed by taking a previously customized PDB file of each molecule and arranging them in a seven rows of ten molecules and duplicated and rotated to form a bilayer. The 140-molecule bilayer contained 98 DOPC molecules and 42 DOPG molecules, in a 7:3 ratio in favour of DOPC. Sodium counter ions were placed near the phosphate moiety of DOPG to counteract the negative charge of DOPG. This was representative of the lipid ratio in a sample used for neutron diffraction. The MD package GROMACS was used for confining the bilayer in a triclinic box, adding Simple Polar Charge water molecules, energy minimization (EM). The bilayer/solvent system was subjected to EM using the steepest descent method to nullify bad contacts and reduce the potential energy of the system. Subsequent MD simulation using an initial NVT (constant number of particles, volume and temperature) for a 20 ps MD run followed by a NPT (constant number of particles, pressure and temperature) was performed. Structural parameters including volume of lipid, area of lipid, order parameter of the fatty acyl carbons and electron density profiles generated by the MD simulation were verified with values obtained from experimental data of DOPC, as there are no comparable experimental data available for the mixed bilayer.},

By incorporation of rhodopsin into a series of phosphatidylcholines of defined composition, we have determined the properties of the lipid environment that are responsible for the altered spectral behavior. Metarhodopsin II is not found in appreciable amounts in bilayers containing acyl chains that are too short (14 or fewer carbon atoms in length), in the presence of only n-alkyl chains, or below the characteristic phase-transition temperature of recombinant membranes. Double bonds are not required for the formation of the metarhodopsin II intermediate, as it is observed in diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine recombinants.},

  Abstract                 = {The Ena-VASP family of proteins act as molecular adaptors linking the cytoskeletal system to signal transduction pathways. Their N-terminal EVH1 domains use groups of exposed aromatic residues to specifically recognize 'FPPPP' motifs found in the mammalian zyxin and vinculin proteins, and ActA protein of the intracellular bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. Here, evidence is provided that the affinities of these EVH1-peptide interactions are strongly dependent on the recognition of residues flanking the core FPPPP motifs. Determination of the VASP EVH1 domain solution structure, together with peptide library screening, measurement of individual K(d)s by fluorescence titration, and NMR chemical shift mapping, revealed a second affinity-determining epitope present in all four ActA EVH1-binding motifs. The epitope was shown to interact with a complementary hydrophobic site on the EVH1 surface and to increase strongly the affinity of ActA for EVH1 domains. We propose that this epitope, which is absent in the sequences of the native EVH1-interaction partners zyxin and vinculin, may provide the pathogen with an advantage when competing for the recruitment of the host VASP and Mena proteins in the infected cell.},

  Abstract                 = {The movements of transmembrane segments (TMs) 3 and 6 at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane play an important role in the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors. Here we provide evidence for the existence of an ionic lock that constrains the relative mobility of the cytoplasmic ends of TM3 and TM6 in the inactive state of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor. We propose that the highly conserved Arg-131(3.50) at the cytoplasmic end of TM3 interacts both with the adjacent Asp-130(3.49) and with Glu-268(6.30) at the cytoplasmic end of TM6. Such a network of ionic interactions has now been directly supported by the high-resolution structure of the inactive state of rhodopsin. We hypothesized that the network of interactions would serve to constrain the receptor in the inactive state, and the release of this ionic lock could be a key step in receptor activation. To test this hypothesis, we made charge-neutralizing mutations of Glu-268(6.30) and of Asp-130(3.49) in the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor. Alone and in combination, we observed a significant increase in basal and pindolol-stimulated cAMP accumulation in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the mutant receptors. Moreover, based on the increased accessibility of Cys-285(6.47) in TM6, we provide evidence for a conformational rearrangement of TM6 that is highly correlated with the extent of constitutive activity of the different mutants. The present experimental data together with the recent high-resolution structure of rhodopsin suggest that ionic interactions between Asp/Glu(3.49), Arg(3.50), and Glu(6.30) may constitute a common switch governing the activation of many rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors.},

  Abstract                 = {We are interested in modeling the membrane-spanning domain of the serotonin 5-HT1A G-protein coupled receptor. This superfamily of proteins is predicted to share the topology of the seven transmembrane helices of bacteriorhodopsin (BR), even though no significant sequence homology had been identified. We found significant homologies by allowing for helix shuffling corresponding to minimal exon shuffling during evolution. Consequently, our strategy for building the model for the 5-HT1A receptor has been to construct hypotheses concerning helix-helix interactions, their orientations, and arrangement in bundles surrounded by lipid, based on the 3.5 A resolution structure of BR. Inferences resulting from such models were tested against the 2.3 A resolution structure of the photosynthetic reaction center (PRC) from Rhodobacter Viridis. These comparisons led us to a reevaluation of current methods for the identification and topological orientation of membrane-embedded alpha-helices. We find that methods used currently in the construction of helical transmembrane domains could be misleading if used indiscriminately. These methods include the hydrophobicity profile, the hydrophobic moment, helix amphiphilicity, and charge neutralization. A refinement is proposed here, based on empirical observations, molecular modeling, and physicochemical considerations designed to overcome some of the shortcomings inherent in the use of the above mentioned methods. Here we present the analysis of two of the motifs identified in our study that led to the proposed refinements: the distribution of acidic and basic residues in the transmembranal domains, and the kink induced by a Pro residue in an alpha-helix.},

We now report the cloning, expression, and purification of apo A-I derived from zebrafish (Danio rerio), which combines with phospholipids to form similar discoidal bilayers and may prove to be superior to human apo A-I constructs for rapid reconstitution of seven-transmembrane helix receptors into nanoscale apolipoprotein bound bilayers (NABBs). We characterized NABBs by gel-filtration chromatography, native polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis, UV-visible photobleaching difference spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy. We used electron microscopy to determine the stoichiometry and orientation of rhodopsin (rho)-containing NABBs prepared under various conditions and correlated stability and signaling efficiency of rho in NABBs with either one or two receptors. We discovered that the specific activity of G protein coupling for single rhos sequestered in individual NABBs was nearly identical with that of two rhos per NABB under conditions where stoichiometry and orientation could be inferred by electron microscopy imaging. Thermal stability of rho in NABBs was superior to that of rho in various commonly used detergents. We conclude that the NABB system using engineered zebrafish apo A-I is a native-like membrane mimetic system for G-protein-coupled receptors and discuss strategies for rapid incorporation of expressed membrane proteins into NABBs.},

  abstract             = {10.1073/pnas.0711563105 Lipid monolayers at an airÃ¢ÂÂwater interface can be compressed laterally and reach high surface density. Beyond a certain threshold, they become unstable and collapse. Lipid monolayer collapse plays an important role in the regulation of surface tension at the airÃ¢ÂÂliquid interface in the lungs. Although the structures of lipid aggregates formed upon collapse can be characterized experimentally, the mechanism leading to these structures is not fully understood. We investigate the molecular mechanism of monolayer collapse using molecular dynamics simulations. Upon lateral compression, the collapse begins with buckling of the monolayer, followed by folding of the buckle into a bilayer in the water phase. Folding leads to an increase in the monolayer surface tension, which reaches the equilibrium spreading value. Immediately after their formation, the bilayer folds have a flat semielliptical shape, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The folds undergo further transformation and form either flat circular bilayers or vesicles. The transformation pathway depends on macroscopic parameters of the system: the bending modulus, the line tension at the monolayerÃ¢ÂÂbilayer connection, and the line tension at the bilayer perimeter. These parameters are determined by the system composition and temperature. Coexistence of the monolayer with lipid aggregates is favorable at lower tensions of the monolayerÃ¢ÂÂbilayer connection. Transformation into a vesicle reduces the energy of the fold perimeter and is facilitated for softer bilayers, e.g., those with a higher content of unsaturated lipids, or at higher temperatures.},

  Abstract                 = {Thermodynamic data are often used to calibrate or test amomic-level (AL) force fields for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In contrast, the majority of coarse-grained (CG) force fields do not rely extensively on thermodynamic quantities. Recently, a CG force field for lipids, hydrocarbons, ions, and water, in which approximately four non-hydrogen atoms are mapped onto one interaction site, has been proposed and applied to study various aspects of lipid systems. To date, no extensive investigation of its capability to describe salvation thermodynamics has been undertaken. In the present study, a detailed picture of vaporization, solvation, and phase-partitioning thermodynamics for liquid hydrocarbons and water was obtained at CG and AL resolutions, in order to compare the two types or models and evaluate their ability to describe thermodynamic properties in the temperature range between 263 and 343 K. Both CG and AL models capture the experimental dependence of the thermodynamic properties on the temperature, albeit a systematically weaker dependence is found for the CG model. Moreover, deviations are found for solvation thermodynamics and for the corresponding enthalpy-entropy compensation for the CG model. Particularly water/oil repulsion seems to be overestimated. However, the results suggest that the thermodynamic properties considered should be reproducible by a CG model provided it is reparametrized on the basis of these liquid-phase properties.},

However, membrane proteins are typically longer than 200 aa and represent a formidable challenge for structure prediction. We have developed a method for predicting the structures of large membrane proteins by constraining helixÃ¢ÂÂhelix packing arrangements at particular positions predicted from sequence or identified by experiments. We tested the method on 12 membrane proteins of diverse topologies and functions with lengths ranging between 190 and 300 residues. Enforcing a single constraint during the folding simulations enriched the population of near-native models for 9 proteins. In 4 of the cases in which the constraint was predicted from the sequence, 1 of the 5 lowest energy models was superimposable within 4 \r{A} on the native structure. Near-native structures could also be selected for heme-binding and pore-forming domains from simulations in which pairs of conserved histidine-chelating hemes and one experimentally determined salt bridge were constrained, respectively. These results suggest that models within 4 \r{A} of the native structure can be achieved for complex membrane proteins if even limited information on residue-residue interactions can be obtained from protein structure databases or experiments.},

The common method used for this purposeÃ¢ÂÂumbrella sampling with weighted histogram analysisÃ¢ÂÂis computationally very laborious, which limits its applications. Recently, a much simpler alternative for PMF calculations has become available, namely, using Jarzynski's equality in steered molecular dynamics simulations. So far, there have been a few comparisons of the two methods and mostly in simple systems that do not reflect the complexities of protein-ligand systems. Here, we use both methods to calculate the PMF for ion permeation and ligand binding to ion channels. Comparison of results indicate that Jarzynski's method suffers from relaxation problems in complex systems and would require much longer simulation times to yield reliable PMFs for protein-ligand systems.},

H., Grinkova, Y. V., and Sligar, S. G. (2002) Nano. Lett. 2, 853-856). Integral membrane proteins can be self-assembled into the Nanodisc bilayer with defined stoichiometry, which allows an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the nature of the oligomerization state of a G-protein-coupled receptor and its coupling to heterotrimeric G-proteins. We generated Nanodiscs having one and two rhodopsins present in the 10-nm-diameter lipid bilayer domain. Efficient transducin activation and isolation of a high affinity transducin-metarhodopsin II complex was demonstrated for a monodisperse and monomeric receptor. A population of Nanodiscs containing two rhodopsins was generated using an increased ratio of receptor to membrane scaffold protein in the self-assembly mixture. The two-rhodopsin population was isolated and purified by density gradient centrifugation. Interestingly, in this case, only one of the two receptors present in the Nanodisc was able to form a stable metarhodopsin II-G-protein complex. Thus there is clear evidence that a monomeric rhodopsin is capable of full coupling to transducin. Importantly, presumably due to steric interactions, it appears that only a single receptor in the Nanodiscs containing two rhodopsins can interact with G-protein. These results have important implications for the stoichiometry of receptor-G-protein coupling and cross talk in signaling pathways.},

  Abstract                 = {Linear peptide antibiotics have been isolated from amphibians, insects and humans and used as templates to design cheaper and more potent analogues for medical applications. Peptides such as cecropins or magainins are < or = 40 amino acids in length. Many of them have been prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis with isotopic labels incorporated at selected sites. Structural analysis by solid-state NMR spectroscopy and other biophysical techniques indicates that these peptide antibiotics strongly interact with lipid membranes. In bilayer environments they exhibit amphipathic alpha-helical conformations and alignments of the helix axis parallel to the membrane surface. This contrasts the transmembrane orientations observed for alamethicin or gramicidin A. Models that have been proposed to explain the antibiotic and pore-forming activities of membrane-associated peptides, as well as other experimental results, include transmembrane helical bundles, wormholes, carpets, detergent-like effects or the in-plane diffusion of peptide-induced bilayer instabilities.},

The enthalpies of solution were obtained from calorimetry of the perchlorates of [Co(bipy)(3)](3+) and [Co(bipy)(3)](2+). The single-ion transfer entropies were calculated via the tetraphenylarsonium tetraphenylborate assumption. In addition polarography, cyclic voltammetry and UV-visible spectroscopy were also performed on these complexes in water-acetonitrile mixtures. Gibbs energies of transfer of [Co(bipy)(3)](+) were derived from the Delta (t)G degrees values for [Co(bipy)(3)](2+) and from electrochemical measurements. The T Delta S-t degrees values for [Co(bipy)(3)](3+) and[Co(bipy)(3)](2+) were calculated from the enthalpies and the Gibbs energies of transfer. The T Delta S-t degrees values of [Co(bipy)(3)](+) were obtained from the respective data for [Co(bipy)(3)](2+) and from the assumption of a negligible thermal diffusion potential. The Gibbs energies of transfer are accounted for in terms of hydrogen-hydrogen interactions between the methyl group of acetonitrile and the hydrogen atoms of the ligands of the studied complexes. The interpretations of T Delta S-t degrees values and the enthalpies of transfer were based on different regions for the structure of acetonitrile-water mixtures and on the possibility of the Co-bipy cations entering cavities in the water structure of water-rich mixtures.},

Rhodopsin stability was examined using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The thermal unfolding transition temperature (Tm) of rhodopsin was scan rate dependent, demonstrating the presence of a kinetically controlled component of denaturation. The activation energy of this kinetically controlled process (Ea) was determined from DSC thermograms by four separate methods. Both Tm and Ea varied with bilayer composition. Cholesterol increased Tm both in the presence and absence of DHA acyl chains. In contrast, cholesterol lowered Ea in the absence DHA acyl chains, but raised Ea in the presence of 20 mol\% DHA-containing phospholipid. Relative acyl chain packing order was determined from measurements of diphenylhexatriene fluorescence anisotropy decay. Tm for thermal unfolding was inversely related to acyl chain packing order. Rhodopsin kinetic stability (Ea) was reduced in highly ordered or disordered membranes. Maximal kinetic stability was found within the range of acyl chain order found in native bovine rod outer segment disk membranes. The results demonstrate that membrane composition has distinct effects on the thermal versus kinetic stabilities of membrane proteins, and suggests that a balance between membrane constituents with opposite effects on acyl chain packing, such as DHA and cholesterol, may be required for maximum protein stability. 10.1529/biophysj.107.122788},

  Abstract                 = {We have recently shown that current molecular dynamics (MD) atomic force fields are not yet able to produce lipid bilayer structures that agree with experimentally-determined structures within experimental errors. Because of the many advantages offered by experimentally validated simulations, we have developed a novel restraint method for membrane MD simulations that uses experimental diffraction data. The restraints, introduced into the MD force field, act upon specified groups of atoms to restrain their mean positions and widths to values determined experimentally. The method was first tested using a simple liquid argon system, and then applied to a neat dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayer at 66\% relative humidity and to the same bilayer containing the peptide melittin. Application of experiment-based restraints to the transbilayer double-bond and water distributions of neat DOPC bilayers led to distributions that agreed with the experimental values. Based upon the experimental structure, the restraints improved the simulated structure in some regions while introducing larger differences in others, as might be expected from imperfect force fields. For the DOPC-melittin system, the experimental transbilayer distribution of melittin was used as a restraint. The addition of the peptide caused perturbations of the simulated bilayer structure, but which were larger than observed experimentally. The melittin distribution of the simulation could be fit accurately to a Gaussian with parameters close to the observed ones, indicating that the restraints can be used to produce an ensemble of membrane-bound peptide conformations that are consistent with experiments. Such ensembles pave the way for understanding peptide-bilayer interactions at the atomic level.},

  Abstract                 = {Conformational transitions underlie the function of many biomolecular systems. Resolving intermediate structural changes, however, is challenging for both experiments and all-atom simulations because the duration of transitions is short relative to the lifetime of the stable species. Simplified descriptions based on a single experimental structure, such as elastic network models or GÅ models, are not immediately applicable. Here, we develop a general method that combines multiple coarse-grained models to capture slow conformational transitions. Individually, each model describes one of the experimental structures; together, they approximate the complete energy surface. We demonstrate the method for the helix-to-sheet transition in Arc repressor N11L. We find that the transition involves the partial unfolding of the switch region, and rapid refolding into the alternate structure. Transient local unfolding is consistent with the low hydrogen exchange protection factors of the switch region. Also in agreement with experiment, the isomerization occurs independently of the global folding/dimerization transition.},

  abstract    = {While the quality of the current CHARMM22/CMAP additive force field for proteins has been demonstrated in a large number of applications, limitations in the model with respect to the equilibrium between the sampling of helical and extended conformations in folding simulations have been noted. To overcome this, as well as make other improvements in the model, we present a combination of refinements that should result in enhanced accuracy in simulations of proteins. The common (non Gly, Pro) backbone CMAP potential has been refined against experimental solution NMR data for weakly structured peptides, resulting in a rebalancing of the energies of the Î±-helix and extended regions of the Ramachandran map, correcting the Î±-helical bias of CHARMM22/CMAP. The Gly and Pro CMAPs have been refitted to more accurate quantum-mechanical energy surfaces. Side-chain torsion parameters have been optimized by fitting to backbone-dependent quantum-mechanical energy surfaces, followed by additional empirical optimization targeting NMR scalar couplings for unfolded proteins. A comprehensive validation of the revised force field was then performed against data not used to guide parametrization: (i) comparison of simulations of eight proteins in their crystal environments with crystal structures; (ii) comparison with backbone scalar couplings for weakly structured peptides; (iii) comparison with NMR residual dipolar couplings and scalar couplings for both backbone and side-chains in folded proteins; (iv) equilibrium folding of mini-proteins. The results indicate that the revised CHARMM 36 parameters represent an improved model for the modeling and simulation studies of proteins, including studies of protein folding, assembly and functionally relevant conformational changes.},

We therefore develop an enhanced WE scheme, building on existing ideas, which accelerates attainment of steady state in complex systems. We apply both WE approaches to several model systems, confirming their correctness and efficiency by comparison with brute-force results. The enhanced version is significantly faster than the brute force and straightforward WE for systems with WE bins that accurately reflect the reaction coordinate(s). The new WE methods can also be applied to equilibrium sampling, since equilibrium is a steady state.},

  abstract =             {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are known to exist in dynamic equilibrium between inactive- and several active-state conformations, even in the absence of a ligand. Recent experimental studies on the ÃÂ² 2 adrenergic receptor ( ÃÂ² 2 AR) indicate that structurally different ligands with varying efficacies trigger distinct conformational changes and stabilize different receptor conformations. We have developed a computational method to study the ligand-induced rotational orientation changes in the transmembrane helices of GPCRs. This method involves a systematic spanning of the rotational orientation of the transmembrane helices (TMs) that are in the vicinity of the ligand for predicting the helical rotations that occur on ligand binding. The predicted ligand-stabilized receptor conformations are characterized by a simultaneous lowering of the ligand binding energy and a significant gain in interhelical and receptor-ligand hydrogen bonds. Using the ÃÂ² 2 AR as a model, we show that the receptor conformational state depends on the structure and efficacy of the ligand for a given signaling pathway. We have studied the ligand-stabilized receptor conformations of five different ligands, a full agonist, norepinephrine; a partial agonist, salbutamol; a weak partial agonist, dopamine; a very weak agonist, catechol; and an inverse agonist, ICI-115881. The predicted ligand-stabilized receptor models correlate well with the experimentally observed conformational switches in ÃÂ² 2 AR, namely, the breaking of the ionic lock between R131 3.50 at the intracellular end of TM3 (part of the DRY motif) and E268 6.30 on TM6, and the rotamer toggle switch on W286 6.48 on TM6. In agreement with trp-bimane quenching experiments, we found that norepinephrine and dopamine break the ionic lock and engage the rotamer toggle switch, whereas salbutamol, a noncatechol partial agonist only breaks the ionic lock, and the weak agonist catechol only engages the rotamer toggle switch. Norepinephrine and dopamine occupy the same binding region, between TM3, TM5, and TM6, whereas the binding site of salbutamol is shifted toward TM4. Catechol binds deeper into the protein cavity compared to the other ligands, making contact with TM5 and TM6. A part of the catechol binding site overlaps with those of dopamine and norepinephrine but not with that of salbutamol. Virtual ligand screening on 10,060 ligands on the norepinephrine-stabilized receptor conformation shows an enrichment of 38\% compared to ligand unbound receptor conformation. These results show that ligand-induced conformational changes are important for developing functionally specific drugs that will stabilize a particular receptor conformation. These studies represent the first step toward a more universally applicable computational method for studying ligand efficacy and GPCR activation.},

  abstract =             {Activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is initiated by conformational changes in the transmembrane (TM) helices and the intra- and extracellular loops induced by ligand binding. Understanding the conformational changes in GPCRs leading to activation is imperative in deciphering the role of these receptors in the pathology of diseases. Since the crystal structures of activated GPCRs are not yet available, computational methods and biophysical techniques have been used to predict the structures of GPCR active states. We have recently applied the computational method LITiCon to understand the ligand-induced conformational changes in ÃÂ² 2 -adrenergic receptor by ligands of varied efficacies. Here we report a study of the conformational changes associated with the activation of bovine rhodopsin for which the crystal structure of the inactive state is known. Starting from the inactive (dark) state, we have predicted the TM conformational changes that are induced by the isomerization of 11- cis retinal to all- trans retinal leading to the fully activated state, metarhodopsin II. The predicted active state of rhodopsin satisfies all of the 30 known experimental distance constraints. The predicted model also correlates well with the experimentally observed conformational switches in rhodopsin and other class A GPCRs, namely, the breaking of the ionic lock between R135 3.50 at the intracellular end of TM3 (part of the DRY motif) and E247 6.30 on TM6, and the rotamer toggle switch on W265 6.48 on TM6. We observe that the toggling of the W265 6.48 rotamer modulates the bend angle of TM6 around the conserved proline. The rotamer toggling is facilitated by the formation of a water wire connecting S298 7.45 , W265 6.48 and H211 5.46 . As a result, the intracellular ends of TMs 5 and 6 move outward from the protein core, causing large conformational changes at the cytoplasmic interface. The predicted outward movements of TM5 and TM6 are in agreement with the recently published crystal structure of opsin, which is proposed to be close to the active-state structure. In the predicted active state, several residues in the intracellular loops, such as R69, V139 3.54 , T229, Q237, Q239, S240, T243 and V250 6.33 , become more water exposed compared to the inactive state. These residues may be involved in mediating the conformational signal from the receptor to the G protein. From mutagenesis studies, some of these residues, such as V139 3.54 , T229 and V250 6.33 , are already implicated in G-protein activation. The predicted active state also leads to the formation of new stabilizing interhelical hydrogen-bond contacts, such as those between W265 6.48 and H211 5.46 and E122 3.37 and C167 4.56 . These hydrogen-bond contacts serve as potential conformational switches offering new opportunities for future experimental investigations. The calculated retinal binding energy surface shows that binding of an agonist makes the receptor dynamic and flexible and accessible to many conformations, while binding of an inverse agonist traps the receptor in the inactive state and makes the other conformations inaccessible.},

These transitions are induced by the uptake of about one water molecule per lipid molecule in each case and change the lipid headgroups from a frozen, quasi-crystalline to a "melted" state. The partial molar enthalpy and partial molar entropy of water have been determined without significant interference of chain melting by a new adaptation of adsorption calorimetry, called humidity-titration calorimetry, coupled with gravimetry. The potency to form direct hydrogen bonds between the lipid headgroups decides whether the solvation-induced transition is exothermic (as in DODPC, no lipid-lipid H bonds) or endothermic (as in DOPE, lipid-lipid H bonds present). Consequently, the solvation-induced transition in DOPE is entropy-driven, and that in DODPC is enthalpy-driven. The time response of the calorimeter after a stepwise change of RH allows to study the kinetics of hydration with high resolution. In most cases, the response possesses exponential character. Despite several hypotheses that consider the adsorption process or diffusive transport of water, there is no straightforward interpretation of hydration kinetics so far. Hydration/dehydration hystereses were discussed in terms of metastability effects that accompany the formation of a complex structure in the headgroup region of the lipid aggregates.}

Oriented films of these lipids subjected to an atmosphere with definite values of relative humidity were investigated. The choice of DODPC and DOPE was motivated by their common property of undergoing a lyotropic phase transition, which, in each case, nearly exclusively affects the polar part of the lipid aggregates and is, thus, termed "solvation-induced" transition. The temperature-RH phase diagrams of both lipids were determined. The headgroups of both lipids form quasi-crystalline structures at small RH. The long axes of the PE and PC moieties orient essentially parallel with respect to the polar interface of the lipid aggregates. Model-based analyses of IR linear-dichroism data are consistent with the idea that about 8-12 DOPE molecules with disordered chains assemble within one cross-section layer of a ribbonlike phase, P. Dry DODPC forms a subgel phase (SGI) with all-trans acyl chains. At a critical water activity near 0.6, the molecular disorder in the polar region of the lipid aggregates increases distinctly. This "headgroup melting" reflects the solvation-induced transitions leading to the SGII and HII phases in DODPC and DOPE, respectively. Hydrogen-bonding specifics due to the polar parts of both lipids were probed by means of H D exchange. Particularly stable H bonds are indicated to exist in dried DOPE.}

When the cholesterol content is below 25 mol %, the calorimetric endotherms seem to consist of two components, a broad one at considerably lower temperature than the original transition and another component at only slightly lower temperature. This thermotropic behavior can be explained by the assumption of a homogenous distribution of cholesterol in phosphatidylethanolamine bilayers. Scanning calorimetry of equimolar mixtures of phosphatidylethanolamines with phosphatidylcholines, which show either ideal or nonideal mixing properties, reveals that when cholesterol is added to these mixtures it shows no preferential affinity for either of the phospholipids.},

  Abstract                 = {Most antimicrobial peptides exert their activity by interacting with bacterial membranes, thus perturbing their permeability. They are investigated as a possible solution to the insurgence of bacteria resistant to the presently available antibiotic drugs. However, several different models have been proposed for their mechanism of membrane perturbation, and the molecular details of this process are still debated. Here, we compare fluorescence spectroscopy experiments and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations regarding the association with lipid bilayers and lipid perturbation for two different amphiphilic helical antimicrobial peptides, PMAP-23 and trichogin GA IV. PMAP-23, a cationic peptide member of the cathelicidin family, is considered to induce membrane permeability according to the Shai-Matsuzaki-Huang "carpet" model, while trichogin GA IV is a neutral peptide, member of the peptaibol family. Although several lines of evidence suggest a "barrel-stave" mechanism of pore formation for the latter peptide, its length is only half the normal thickness of a lipid bilayer. Both fluorescence spectroscopy experiments and MD simulations indicated that PMAP-23 associates with membranes close to their surface and parallel to it, and in this arrangement it causes a severe perturbation to the bilayer, both regarding its surface tension and lipid order. By contrast, trichogin GA IV can undergo a transition from a surface-bound state to a transmembrane orientation. In the first arrangement, it does not cause any strong membrane perturbation, while in the second orientation it might be able to span the bilayer from one side to the other, despite its relatively short length, by causing a significant thinning of the membrane.

  abstract =             {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven-transmembrane proteins that mediate most cellular responses to hormones and neurotransmitters. They are the largest group of therapeutic targets for a broad spectrum of diseases. Recent crystal structures of GPCRs1, 2, 3, 4, 5 have revealed structural conservation extending from the orthosteric ligand-binding site in the transmembrane core to the cytoplasmic G-protein-coupling domains. In contrast, the extracellular surface (ECS) of GPCRs is remarkably diverse and is therefore an ideal target for the discovery of subtype-selective drugs. However, little is known about the functional role of the ECS in receptor activation, or about conformational coupling of this surface to the native ligand-binding pocket. Here we use NMR spectroscopy to investigate ligand-specific conformational changes around a central structural feature in the ECS of the ÃÂ²2 adrenergic receptor: a salt bridge linking extracellular loops 2 and 3. Small-molecule drugs that bind within the transmembrane core and exhibit different efficacies towards G-protein activation (agonist, neutral antagonist and inverse agonist) also stabilize distinct conformations of the ECS. We thereby demonstrate conformational coupling between the ECS and the orthosteric binding site, showing that drugs targeting this diverse surface could function as allosteric modulators with high subtype selectivity. Moreover, these studies provide a new insight into the dynamic behaviour of GPCRs not addressable by static, inactive-state crystal structures.},

  Abstract                 = {The inducement of K+ permeability through membranes by the polyene antibiotic amphotericin B (AmB) has been analyzed as a measure of the antibiotic activity. Dose-response curves have been obtained with cholesterol- and ergosterol-containing egg yolk phosphatidylcholine large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs), human erythrocytes, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells. Conductance changes induced by AmB in sterol-containing planar bilayer membranes have also been studied. AmB self-association in aqueous buffer was determined by circular dichroism (CD) as a function of the antibiotic concentration. Electronic absorption and CD spectra of AmB were recorded in the presence of LUVs. For given AmB concentrations, the extent of permeability inducement is dependent on the lipid concentration. On the other hand, for cholesterol-containing LUVs or erythrocytes, a critical AmB concentration had to be reached before any permeability is observed. Independent of lipid concentration, this concentration was directly related to antibiotic self-association in the aqueous buffer. The same observation was made for erythrocytes and nystatin. The AmB absorption and CD spectra were totally different for ergosterol- and cholesterol-containing LUVs. Formation of single channels by one-sided addition of AmB could be observed only in ergosterol-containing membranes. These data lead us to propose that the permeability pathways induced by amphotericin B or nystatin, in ergosterol- and in cholesterol-containing membranes, are of different natures. In the latter case the antibiotics are only active, by single-sided addition, in the self-associated form. These findings offer important clues for the design of less toxic derivatives of AmB: they should have a low degree of self-association in water.},

  Abstract                 = {Physico-chemical methods are being developed for use in the control and standardization of acellular pertussis vaccines and their individual components. We have compared native and detoxified preparations of the B. pertussis antigens, pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous haemagglutinin (FHA), and the 69-kDa outer membrane protein (P69) using circular dichroism (CD), fluorescence spectroscopy, SDS-PAGE and FPLC gel filtration chromatography. Upon aldehyde detoxification, PT underwent a large change in its intrinsic fluorescence maximum (8-10 nm red-shift) and a large increase in its apparent size, detected by chromatography. Polyacrylamide gels showed individual subunits of the same apparent molecular weight (M(r)) as well as some polypeptides of higher M(r). FHA also changed conformation (5-nm red-shift in intrinsic fluorescence) upon aldehyde detoxification, with a resultant increase in the M(r)of its major constituent. The P69 protein appeared quite robust to formaldehyde treatment as measured by the same methods. Its near-UV CD spectrum contains a prominent tryptophan band; so this method may be more suitable for observing differences in conformation. We also examined an aluminium-desorbed DTaP preparation by these methods. When used in conjunction with immunochemical and toxicological assays, these methods are informative and useful in the characterization of candidate standards and should be valuable methods for ensuring the consistency of manufactured vaccines.},

  Abstract                 = {Antibacterial peptides are the effector molecules of innate immunity. Generally they contain 15-45 amino acid residues and the net charge is positive. The cecropin type of linear peptides without cysteine were found first in insects, whilst the defensin type with three disulphide bridges were found in rabbit granulocytes. Now a database stores more than 800 sequences of antibacterial peptides and proteins from the animal and plant kingdoms. Generally, each species has 15-40 peptides made from genes, which code for only one precursor. The dominating targets are bacterial membranes and the killing reaction must be faster than the growth rate of the bacteria. Some antibacterial peptides are clearly multifunctional and an attempt to predict this property from the hydrophobicity of all amino acid side chains are given. Gene structures and biosynthesis are known both in the fruit fly Drosophila and several mammals. Humans need two classes of defensins and the cathelicidin-derived linear peptide LL-37. Clinical cases show that deficiencies in these peptides give severe symptoms. Examples given are morbus Kostmann and atopic allergy. Several antibacterial peptides are being developed as drugs.},

Simulations have been used to compare the effect of lipid or detergent on the structure and dynamics of membrane proteins. Moreover, some of the longest and most complex simulations to date have been used to observe the spontaneous formation of membrane protein-detergent micelles. Common mechanistic steps in the micelle self-assembly process were identified for both alpha-helical and beta-barrel membrane proteins, and a simple kinetic mechanism was proposed. Recently, simplified (i.e. coarse-grained) models have been utilized to follow long timescale transitions in membrane protein-detergent assemblies.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provide a valuable approach to the dynamics, structure, and stability of membrane-protein systems. Coarse-grained (CG) models, in which small groups of atoms are treated as single particles, enable extended (>100 ns) timescales to be addressed. In this study, we explore how CG-MD methods that have been developed for detergents and lipids may be extended to membrane proteins. In particular, CG-MD simulations of a number of membrane peptides and proteins are used to characterize their interactions with lipid bilayers. CG-MD is used to simulate the insertion of synthetic model membrane peptides (WALPs and LS3) into a lipid (PC) bilayer. WALP peptides insert in a transmembrane orientation, whilst the LS3 peptide adopts an interfacial location, both in agreement with experimental biophysical data. This approach is extended to a transmembrane fragment of the Vpu protein from HIV-1, and to the coat protein from fd phage. Again, simulated protein/membrane interactions are in good agreement with solid state NMR data for these proteins. CG-MD has also been applied to an M3-M4 fragment from the CFTR protein. Simulations of CFTR M3-M4 in a detergent micelle reveal formation of an alpha-helical hairpin, consistent with a variety of biophysical data. In an I231D mutant, the M3-M4 hairpin is additionally stabilized via an inter-helix Q207/D231 interaction. Finally, CG-MD simulations are extended to a more complex membrane protein, the bacterial sugar transporter LacY. Comparison of a 200 ns CG-MD simulation of LacY in a DPPC bilayer with a 50 ns atomistic simulation of the same protein in a DMPC bilayer shows that the two methods yield comparable predictions of lipid-protein interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate the utility of CG-MD simulations for studies of membrane/protein interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Interactions of lipids are central to the folding and stability of membrane proteins. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations have been used to reveal the mechanisms of self-assembly of protein/membrane and protein/detergent complexes for representatives of two classes of membrane protein, namely, glycophorin (a simple alpha-helical bundle) and OmpA (a beta-barrel). The accuracy of the coarse-grained simulations is established via comparison with the equivalent atomistic simulations of self-assembly of protein/detergent micelles. The simulation of OmpA/bilayer self-assembly reveals how a folded outer membrane protein can be inserted in a bilayer. The glycophorin/bilayer simulation supports the two-state model of membrane folding, in which transmembrane helix insertion precedes dimer self-assembly within a bilayer. The simulations also suggest that a dynamic equilibrium exists between the glycophorin helix monomer and dimer within a bilayer. The simulated glycophorin helix dimer is remarkably close in structure to that revealed by NMR. Thus, coarse-grained methods may help to define mechanisms of membrane protein (re)folding and will prove suitable for simulation of larger scale dynamic rearrangements of biological membranes.},

  Abstract                 = {Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations are used to explore the interaction with a phospholipid bilayer of the voltage sensor (VS) domain and the S4 helix from the archaebacterial voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channel KvAP. Multiple 2-mus self-assembly simulations reveal that the isolated S4 helix may adopt either interfacial or transmembrane (TM) locations with approximately equal probability. In the TM state, the insertion of the voltage-sensing region of S4 is facilitated via local bilayer deformation that, combined with side chain "snorkeling," enables its Arg side chains to interact with lipid headgroups and water. Multiple 0.2-mus self-assembly simulations of the VS domain are also performed, along with simulations of MscL and KcsA, to permit comparison with more "canonical" integral membrane protein structures. All three stably adopt a TM orientation within a bilayer. For MscL and KcsA, there is no significant bilayer deformation. In contrast, for the VS, there is considerable local deformation, which is again primarily due to the lipid-exposed S4. It is shown that for both the VS and isolated S4 helix, the positively charged side chains of S4 are accommodated within the membrane through a combination of stabilizing interactions with lipid glycerol and headgroup regions, water, and anionic side chains. Our results support the possibility that bilayer deformation around key gating charge residues in Kv channels may result in "focusing" of the electrostatic field, and indicate that, when considering competing models of voltage-sensing, it is essential to consider the dynamics and structure of not only the protein but also of the local lipid environment.},

The Rehm-Weller Gibbs energy relationship is applied to determine the fundamental parameters for the one-electron reduction, i.e., the one-electron reduction potentials (ERX/RX- .) of the halomethanes and the intrinsic barrier for the electron transfer reduction (Delta G double dagger(o)). The E- RX/RX(-). values obtained were related to the concerted electron transfer-bond breaking reduction potentials (E-RX/R.(- )(+X).) and the standard free enthalpies of dissociation of RX- .(Delta G(RX)(o,diss)(-).) were estimated in each solvent. Additionally, the one-electron reduction potential (E-RX/RX(- ).) values estimated in acetonitrile were also related to different thermodynamic parameters such as electron affinity (E-A), LUMO-HOMO energy differences (Delta E) and the bond dissociation energy (D-RX). Optimized geometry, E-A and Delta E for halomethanes were calculated by an ab initio method at the B3LYP level using 3-21G, 6-31+G(d,p) and G-311+G(3df,2pd) basis sets. In all these cases good linear correlations were obtained. The Delta G double dagger(o) values obtained are compared with those calculated using the equation Delta G double dagger(o)=lambda/4 with lambda=lambda(i)+lambda(o) where the solvent reorganization energy (lambda(o)) and the inner- sphere reorganization energies (lambda(i)) associated with the structural change upon the electron-transfer process were calculated, the former by using the Marcus-Hush model and the latter by using semiempirical and ab initio molecular modeling and QSAR properties. Results obtained from the preparative irradiation of carbazoles in the presence of halomethanes, which are consistent with a photoinduced electron transfer mechanism are also discussed.},

Here we present a simple reweighting algorithm for recovering the unbiased probability distribution of any variable from a well-tempered metadynamics simulation. We show the efficiency of the reweighting procedure by reconstructing the distribution of the four backbone dihedral angles of alanine dipeptide from two and even one dimensional metadynamics simulation.},

  annotation = {A dimeric alamethicin analog with lysine at position 18 in the sequence (alm-K18) was previously shown to form stable anion- selective channels in membranes at pH 7.0 [Starostin, A.V., R. Butan, V. Borisenko, D. A. James, H, Wenschuh, WI. S, Sansom, and G. A. Woolley. 1999. Biochemistry. 38:6144-6150]. To probe the charge state of the conducting channel and how this might influence cation versus anion selectivity, we performed a series of single-channel selectivity measurements at different pH values, At pH 7.0 and below, only anion-selective channels were found with PK+/PCl- = 0.25. From pH 8-10,:a mixture of anion-selective, non-selective, and cation-selective channels was found. At pH > 11 only cation-selective channels were found with PK+/PCl- = 4, In contrast, native alamethicin-Q18 channels (with Gin in place of Lys at position 18) were cation-selective (PK+/PCl- = 4) at all pH values. Continuum electrostatics calculations were then carried out using an octameric model of the alm-K18 channel embedded in a low dielectric slab to simulate a membrane. Although the calculations can account for the apparent pK(a) of the channel, they fail to correctly predict the degree of selectivity. Although a switch from cation- to anion-selectivity as the channel becomes protonated :is indicated, the degree of anion-selectivity is severely overestimated, suggesting that the continuum approach does not adequately represent some aspect of the electrostatics of permeation in these channels. Side-chain conformational changes upon protonation, conformational changes, and deprotonation Caused by permeating cations and counterion binding by lysine residues upon protonation are considered as possible sources of the overestimation.},

Until the last decade, structural information about this family of membrane proteins was relatively scarce, and their mechanisms of ligand binding and signal transduction were modeled on the assumption that GPCRs existed and functioned as monomeric entities. New crystal structures of native and engineered GPCRs, together with important biochemical and biophysical data that reveal structural details of the activation mechanism(s) of this receptor family, provide a valuable framework to improve dynamic molecular models of GPCRs with the ultimate goal of elucidating their allostery and functional selectivity. Since the dynamic movements of single GPCR protomers are likely to be affected by the presence of neighboring interacting subunits, oligomeric arrangements should be taken into account to improve the predictive ability of computer-assisted structural models of GPCRs for effective use in drug design.},

It was found that compounds with chemical shift for C-4 value falling in the range of 135-140 ppm exhibited significant antiproliferative activity, while compounds which possess moderate or low activity are located in the range 140-165 ppm.

  abstract    = {Markov state models (MSMs) are a powerful tool for modeling both the thermodynamics and kinetics of molecular systems. In addition, they provide a rigorous means to combine information from multiple sources into a single model and to direct future simulations/experiments to minimize uncertainties in the model. However, constructing MSMs is challenging because doing so requires decomposing the extremely high dimensional and rugged free energy landscape of a molecular system into long-lived states, also called metastable states. Thus, their application has generally required significant chemical intuition and hand-tuning. To address this limitation we have developed a toolkit for automating the construction of MSMs called MSMBUILDER (available at https://simtk.org/home/msmbuilder). In this work we demonstrate the application of MSMBUILDER to the villin headpiece (HP-35 NleNle), one of the smallest and fastest folding proteins. We show that the resulting MSM captures both the thermodynamics and kinetics of the original molecular dynamics of the system. As a first step toward experimental validation of our methodology we show that our model provides accurate structure prediction and that the longest timescale events correspond to folding.},

  Abstract                 = {Dystroglycan (DG) is an adhesion molecule playing a crucial role for tissue stability during both early embriogenesis and adulthood and is composed by two tightly interacting subunits: alpha-DG, membrane-associated and highly glycosylated, and the transmembrane beta-DG. Recently, by solid-phase binding assays and NMR experiments, we have shown that the C-terminal domain of alpha-DG interacts with a recombinant extracellular fragment of beta-DG (positions 654-750) independently from glycosylation and that the linear binding epitope is located between residues 550 and 565 of alpha-DG. In order to elucidate which moieties of beta-DG are specifically involved in the complex with alpha-DG, the ectodomain has been recombinantly expressed and purified in a labeled ((13)C,(15)N) form and studied by multidimensional NMR. Although it represents a natively unfolded protein domain, we obtained an almost complete backbone assignment. Chemical shift index, (1)H-(15)N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence and nuclear Overhauser effect (HSQC-NOESY) spectra and (3)J(HN,H)(alpha) coupling constant values confirm that this protein is highly disordered, but (1)H-(15)N steady-state NOE experiments indicate that the protein presents two regions of different mobility. The first one, between residues 659 and 722, is characterized by a limited degree of mobility, whereas the C-terminal portion, containing about 30 amino acids, is highly flexible. The binding of beta-DG(654-750) to the C-terminal region of the alpha subunit, alpha-DG(485-620), has been investigated, showing that the region of beta-DG(654-750) between residues 691 and 719 is involved in the interaction.},

  Abstract                 = {To better understand origin recognition and initiation of DNA replication, we have examined by NMR complexes formed between the origin-binding domain of SV40 T antigen (T-ag-obd), the initiator protein of the SV40 virus, and cognate and noncognate DNA oligomers. The results reveal two structural effects associated with "origin-specific" binding that are absent in nonspecific DNA binding. The first is the formation of a hydrogen bond (H-bond) involving His 203, a residue that genetic studies have previously identified as crucial to both specific and nonspecific DNA binding in full-length T antigen. In free T-ag-obd, the side chain of His 203 has a pK(a) value of approximately 5, titrating to the N(epsilon)(1)H tautomer at neutral pH (Sudmeier, J. L., et al. (1996) J. Magn. Reson., Ser. B 113, 236-247). In complexes with origin DNA, His 203 N(delta)(1) becomes protonated and remains nontitrating as the imidazolium cation at all pH values from 4 to 8. The H-bonded N(delta1)H resonates at 15.9 ppm, an unusually large N-H proton chemical shift, of a magnitude previously observed only in the catalytic triad of serine proteases at low pH. The formation of this H-bond requires the middle G/C base pair of the recognition pentanucleotide, GAGGC. The second structural effect is a selective distortion of the A/T base pair characterized by a large (0.6 ppm) upfield chemical-shift change of its Watson-Crick proton, while nearby H-bonded protons remain relatively unaffected. The results indicate that T antigen, like many other DNA-binding proteins, may employ "catalytic" or "transition-state-like" interactions in binding its cognate DNA (Jen-Jacobson, L. (1997) Biopolymers 44, 153-180), which may be the solution to the well-known paradox between the relatively modest DNA-binding specificity exhibited by initiator proteins and the high specificity of initiation.},

In addition, we predicted the SAR data for a series of psilocybin analogs, both agonists and antagonists. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) on serotonin bound to 5-HT 2C and we find the protein and binding site to be stable after 5ÃÂ ns. We find good agreement with the currently known experimental data and we predict a number of new mutations which could be used to validate further our predicted structures. This agreement between theory and experiment suggests that our 3D structure is sufficiently accurate for use in drug design. We also compare a preliminary prediction for 5-HT 2B with our prediction for 5-HT 2C and find a difference in TM5 that contributes to different serotonin binding modes in 5-HT 2B and 5-HT 2C .},

These types of proteins may be productively analyzed using polymer theory developed to predict global physical properties of polymers. In these theories molecular detail is "coarse grained" out of the models, and replaced with a small number of parameters that characterize the polymer. This reduction in complexity allows extremely large systems to be studied. In the case of simulations, the time scales accessible also increase significantly. Here we discuss the application of polymer theory to unstructured proteins, and consider how to classify proteins within a polymer framework. We then review polymer theory that is relevant to predicting functionally important properties, such as radius of gyration., height of a polymer brush and force required to compress a polymer brush.

Upon cooling from dilute isotropic micellar solutions, this surfactant crystallizes into micrometer-sized tubular structures that induce gelation of the system. The tubules have been characterized in terms of morphology, assembly process, thermal behavior, and stability, by using differential scanning calorimetry, light and scanning electron microscopy, and deuterium NMR. Possible mechanisms for tubule assembly are discussed, on the basis of surfactant molecular shape, H-bonding and electrostatic interactions, and chirality effects.},

Here we discuss recent advances in understanding how the mammalian nervous system, equipped with neuropeptides and peptide hormones with potent antimicrobial properties, might directly defend the host from microbial assault. As examples, we have chosen five well described, locally produced neuropeptides that may serve a previously unrecognized, direct antimicrobial, innate immune function in four anatomical sites.},

  abstract    = {CHARMM (Chemistry at HARvard Molecular Mechanics) is a highly versatile and widely used molecular simulation program. It has been developed over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model-building capabilities. The CHARMM program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems. Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original CHARMM article in 1983.},

Moreover, these compounds can prime systemic induction of antimicrobial compounds in cucumber leaves similarly to the plant-beneficial fungus Trichoderma asperellum T203 and provide systemic protection against the phytopathogens Botrytis cinerea B05, Pseudomonas syringae pv. lachrimans, and P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000.

  Abstract                 = {Solid-state 2H NMR spectroscopy gives a powerful avenue to investigating the structures of ligands and cofactors bound to integral membrane proteins. For bacteriorhodopsin (bR) and rhodopsin, retinal was site-specifically labeled by deuteration of the methyl groups followed by regeneration of the apoprotein. 2H NMR studies of aligned membrane samples were conducted under conditions where rotational and translational diffusion of the protein were absent on the NMR time scale. The theoretical lineshape treatment involved a static axial distribution of rotating C-C2H3 groups about the local membrane frame, together with the static axial distribution of the local normal relative to the average normal. Simulation of solid-state 2H NMR lineshapes gave both the methyl group orientations and the alignment disorder (mosaic spread) of the membrane stack. The methyl bond orientations provided the angular restraints for structural analysis. In the case of bR the retinal chromophore is nearly planar in the dark- and all-trans light-adapted states, as well upon isomerization to 13-cis in the M state. The C13-methyl group at the "business end" of the chromophore changes its orientation to the membrane upon photon absorption, moving towards W182 and thus driving the proton pump in energy conservation. Moreover, rhodopsin was studied as a prototype for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) implicated in many biological responses in humans. In contrast to bR, the retinal chromophore of rhodopsin has an 11-cis conformation and is highly twisted in the dark state. Three sites of interaction affect the torsional deformation of retinal, viz. the protonated Schiff base with its carboxylate counterion; the C9-methyl group of the polyene; and the beta-ionone ring within its hydrophobic pocket. For rhodopsin, the strain energy and dynamics of retinal as established by 2H NMR are implicated in substituent control of activation. Retinal is locked in a conformation that is twisted in the direction of the photoisomerization, which explains the dark stability of rhodopsin and allows for ultra-fast isomerization upon absorption of a photon. Torsional strain is relaxed in the meta I state that precedes subsequent receptor activation. Comparison of the two retinal proteins using solid-state 2H NMR is thus illuminating in terms of their different biological functions.},

  Abstract                 = {Solid-state NMR spectroscopy gives a powerful avenue for investigating G protein-coupled receptors and other integral membrane proteins in a native-like environment. This article reviews the use of solid-state (2)H NMR to study the retinal cofactor of rhodopsin in the dark state as well as the meta I and meta II photointermediates. Site-specific (2)H NMR labels have been introduced into three regions (methyl groups) of retinal that are crucially important for the photochemical function of rhodopsin. Despite its phenomenal stability (2)H NMR spectroscopy indicates retinal undergoes rapid fluctuations within the protein binding cavity. The spectral lineshapes reveal the methyl groups spin rapidly about their three-fold (C(3)) axes with an order parameter for the off-axial motion of SC(3) approximately 0.9. For the dark state, the (2)H NMR structure of 11-cis-retinal manifests torsional twisting of both the polyene chain and the beta-ionone ring due to steric interactions of the ligand and the protein. Retinal is accommodated within the rhodopsin binding pocket with a negative pretwist about the C11=C12 double bond. Conformational distortion explains its rapid photochemistry and reveals the trajectory of the 11-cis to trans isomerization. In addition, (2)H NMR has been applied to study the retinylidene dynamics in the dark and light-activated states. Upon isomerization there are drastic changes in the mobility of all three methyl groups. The relaxation data support an activation mechanism whereby the beta-ionone ring of retinal stays in nearly the same environment, without a large displacement of the ligand. Interactions of the beta-ionone ring and the retinylidene Schiff base with the protein transmit the force of the retinal isomerization. Solid-state (2)H NMR thus provides information about the flow of energy that triggers changes in hydrogen-bonding networks and helix movements in the activation mechanism of the photoreceptor.},

  Abstract                 = {Rhodopsin is a canonical member of class A of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are implicated in many of the drug interventions in humans and are of great pharmaceutical interest. The molecular mechanism of rhodopsin activation remains unknown as atomistic structural information for the active metarhodopsin II state is currently lacking. Solid-state (2)H NMR constitutes a powerful approach to study atomic-level dynamics of membrane proteins. In the present application, we describe how information is obtained about interactions of the retinal cofactor with rhodopsin that change with light activation of the photoreceptor. The retinal methyl groups play an important role in rhodopsin function by directing conformational changes upon transition into the active state. Site-specific (2)H labels have been introduced into the methyl groups of retinal and solid-state (2)H NMR methods applied to obtain order parameters and correlation times that quantify the mobility of the cofactor in the inactive dark state, as well as the cryotrapped metarhodopsin I and metarhodopsin II states. Analysis of the angular-dependent (2)H NMR line shapes for selectively deuterated methyl groups of rhodopsin in aligned membranes enables determination of the average ligand conformation within the binding pocket. The relaxation data suggest that the beta-ionone ring is not expelled from its hydrophobic pocket in the transition from the pre-activated metarhodopsin I to the active metarhodopsin II state. Rather, the major structural changes of the retinal cofactor occur already at the metarhodopsin I state in the activation process. The metarhodopsin I to metarhodopsin II transition involves mainly conformational changes of the protein within the membrane lipid bilayer rather than the ligand. The dynamics of the retinylidene methyl groups upon isomerization are explained by an activation mechanism involving cooperative rearrangements of extracellular loop E2 together with transmembrane helices H5 and H6. These activating movements are triggered by steric clashes of the isomerized all-trans retinal with the beta4 strand of the E2 loop and the side chains of Glu(122) and Trp(265) within the binding pocket. The solid-state (2)H NMR data are discussed with regard to the pathway of the energy flow in the receptor activation mechanism.},

They are derived from the host membranes from which virus budding occurs, but the precise lipid composition has not been determined for any virus. Employing mass spectrometry, this study provides a quantitative analysis of the lipid constituents of HIV and a comprehensive comparison with its host membranes. Both a substantial enrichment of the unusual sphingolipid dihydrosphingomyelin and a loss of viral infectivity upon inhibition of sphingolipid biosynthesis in host cells are reported, establishing a critical role for this lipid class in the HIV replication cycle. Intriguingly, the overall lipid composition of native HIV membranes resembles detergent-resistant membrane microdomains and is strikingly different from that of host cell membranes. With this composition, the HIV lipidome provides strong evidence for the existence of lipid rafts in living cells. 10.1073/pnas.0511136103},

Recently, it has been reported that two unrelated GPCRs, namely class C metabotropic glutamate receptor type-2 (mGluR2) and class A 5HT2A serotoninergic receptor, can heterodimerize at the transmembrane domain level. We performed a 40 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the mGluR2/5HT2A heterocomplex constructed around a TM4/TM5 interface and embedded in an explicit phospholipidic bilayer surrounded by water molecules. In a separate experiment, the monomeric 5HT2A receptor was simulated for additional 40 ns under the same conditions. The analysis and the comparison of the two simulations allowed us to clearly identify a cross-talk between the two protomers and to put forward an effect of the heterodimerization on the shape of the binding pocket of 5HT2A. This result provides the first molecular explanation for the reported allosteric effect of mGluR2 on 5HT2A-mediated response and suggests that the heterocomplex can be a more suitable target for in silico screening than the monomeric protomers.},

  Abstract                 = {At low micromolar concentrations, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) alter the function of many membrane proteins. PUFAs exert their effects on unrelated proteins at similar concentrations, suggesting a common mode of action. Because lipid bilayers serve as the common "solvent" for membrane proteins, the common mechanism could be that PUFAs adsorb to the bilayer/solution interface to promote a negative-going change in lipid intrinsic curvature and, like other reversibly adsorbing amphiphiles, increase bilayer elasticity. PUFA adsorption thus would alter the bilayer deformation energy associated with protein conformational changes involving the protein/bilayer boundary, which would alter protein function. To explore the feasibility of such a mechanism, we used gramicidin (gA) analogues of different lengths together with bilayers of different thicknesses to assess whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) could exert its effects through a bilayer-mediated mechanism. Indeed, DHA increases gA channel appearance rates and lifetimes and decreases the free energy of channel formation. The appearance rate and lifetime changes increase with increasing channel-bilayer hydrophobic mismatch and are not related to differing DHA bilayer absorption coefficients. DHA thus alters bilayer elastic properties, not just lipid intrinsic curvature; the elasticity changes are important for DHA's bilayer-modifying actions. Oleic acid (OA), which has little effect on membrane protein function, exerts no such effects despite OA's adsorption coefficient being an order of magnitude greater than DHA's. These results suggest that DHA (and other PUFAs) may modulate membrane protein function by bilayer-mediated mechanisms that do not involve specific protein binding but rather changes in bilayer material properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Rhodopsin is constrained in an inactive conformation by interactions with 11-cis-retinal including formation of a protonated Schiff base with Lys296. Upon photoisomerization, major structural rearrangements that involve protonation of the active site Glu113 and cytoplasmic acidic residues, including Glu134, lead to the formation of the active form of the receptor, metarhodopsin II b, which decays to opsin. However, an activated receptor may be generated without illumination by addition of all-trans-retinal or its analogues to opsin, as measured in this study by the increased phosphorylation of opsin by rhodopsin kinase. The potency of stimulation depended on the chemical and isomeric nature of the analogues and the length of the polyene chain with all-trans-C17 aldehyde and all-trans-retinal being the most active and trans-C12 aldehyde being the least active. Certain cis-isomers, 11-cis-13-demethyl-retinal and 9-cis-C17 aldehyde, were also active. Most of the retinal analogues tested did not regenerate a spectrally identifiable pigment, and many were incapable of Schiff base formation (ketone, stable oximes, and Schiff base-derivatives of retinal). Thus, receptor activation resulted from formation of non-covalent complexes with opsin. pH titrations suggested that an equilibrium exists between partially active (protonated) and inactive (deprotonated) forms of opsin. These findings are consistent with a model in which protonation of one or more cytoplasmic carboxyl groups of opsin is essential for activity. Upon addition of retinoids, the partially active conformation of opsin is converted to a more active intermediate similar to metarhodopsin II b. The model provides an understanding of the structural requirements for opsin activation and an interpretation of the observed activities of natural and experimental opsin mutants.},

According to Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations, rotation of the Im ligand can be fast in the gas phase, but is more hindered in aqueous solution. In the latter, bonding between Im and V is reinforced, and dynamic averaging of GIAO-B3LYP magnetic shieldings affords a gas-to-liquid shift of ca. -100 ppm for delta((51)V). A complete catalytic cycle has been characterized for olefin epoxidation mediated by 1, using H(2)O(2) as oxidant. The rate-determining step is indicated to be initial oxygen atom transfer from 1 to the substrate via a spiro-like transition state. Substituent effects on this barrier are examined, and a significant decrease (by 2-6 kcal/mol) is revealed upon removal of the Im proton or upon complexation with a H-bond acceptor. Implications for the mechanism of the oxidative chemistry of vanadium-dependent haloperoxidases and requirements for prospective biomimetic analogues are discussed.},

Enthalpies of complexation are also reported for two silver ion cryptates. The results are combined with previously determined free energies of complexation to obtain the corresponding entropies. In dipolar aprotic solvents, the enthalpies of transfer of the complexes are very similar to those of the free ligands, so that changes in enthalpies of complexation are dominated by the enthalpies of solvation of the silver cation. The thermodynamics of ligation, i.e., of complex formation between the gaseous silver ion and the diaza-crown and cryptand ligands in solution, are calculated and, for the free energies, partitioned into contributions from each of the donor atoms (N, O, and S). Among the aprotic solvents, contributions of oxygen and sulphur atoms in the ligand bridges to the stabilities of diaza-crown and cryptand complexes are additive and independent of solvent. In methanol, hydrogen bonding between methanol molecules and the free ligands reduces the magnitudes of both the free energies and enthalpies of formation of the silver complexes.},

At low peptide/lipid (P/L) ratio the helices are aligned parallel to membrane surface (S-state), but with increasing concentration they realign to a tilted orientation (T-state), getting immersed into the membrane with an oblique angle supposedly as a result of dimer-formation. In macroscopically aligned liquid crystalline 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine bilayers the two limiting states are represented by distinct OCD spectra, and all spectra at intermediate peptide concentrations can be described by a linear combination of these two line shapes. The corresponding fraction of molecules occupying the T-state was determined by fitting the intermediate spectra with a superposition of the two extreme line shapes. By plotting this fraction versus 1/(P/L), the threshold P/L* ratio for realignment was extracted for each of the three related peptides. Despite their structural similarity distinctly different thresholds were obtained, namely for MSI-103 realignment starts already at a low P/L of [\~{}]1:236, for a MAP derivative (using a nonaggregating analog containing a D-amino acid) the transition begins at P/L [\~{}]1:156, whereas PGLa needs the highest concentration to flip into T-state at P/L [\~{}]1:85. Analysis of the original MAP sequence (containing only L-amino acids) gave OCD spectra compatible with {beta}-pleated conformation, suggesting that this peptide starts to aggregate with increasing concentration, unlike the other helical peptides. All these changes in peptide conformation and membrane alignment observed here by OCD seem to be functionally relevant, as they can be correlated with the membrane perturbing activities of the three antimicrobial and cell-penetrating sequences. 10.1529/biophysj.108.136085},

Despite determined cocrystal structures of the adenosine A2A receptor (A2A AR) in complex with antagonists, agonists and an antibody, the deactivation process of this GPCR is not completely understood. In this study, we investigate the convergence of two apo simulations, one starting with an agonist-bound conformation (PDB: 3QAK)(14) and the other starting with an antagonist-bound conformation (PDB: 3EML)(11) . Despite the two simulations not completely converging, we were able to identify distinct intermediate steps of the deactivation process characterized by the movement of Y288(7.53) in the NPxxY motif. We find that Y288(7.53) contributes to the process by forming hydrogen bonds to residues in transmembrane helices 2 and 7 and losing these interactions upon full deactivation. Y197(5.58) also plays a role in the process by forming a hydrogen bond only once the side chain moves from the lipid interface to the middle of the helical bundle.},

In this work, we assess the accuracy of this approach by considering its application to the case of ribonuclease A. We found that the agreement between experimental and calculated chemical shifts improves on average when the chemical shifts are used as replica-averaged restraints with respect to the cases in which X-ray structures or ensembles of structures obtained by standard molecular dynamics simulations are considered. These results indicate that the use of chemical shifts as structural restraints enables a bias of the conformational sampling to be introduced in a system-specific manner to reproduce accurately the conformational fluctuations of proteins.},

Membrane bending by proteins is necessary for the generation of intracellular transport carriers and for the maintenance of otherwise intrinsically unstable regions of high membrane curvature in cell organelles. Understanding the mechanisms by which proteins curve membranes is therefore of primary importance. Here we suggest for the first time a quantitative mechanism of lipid membrane bending by hydrophobic or amphipathic rod-like inclusions which simulate {alpha} -helices-structures shown to sculpt membranes. Considering the lipid monolayer matrix as an anisotropic elastic material, we compute the intra-membrane stresses and strains generated by the embedded inclusions, determine the resulting membrane shapes and the accumulated elastic energy. We characterize the ability of an inclusion to bend membranes by an effective spontaneous curvature, and show that shallow rod-like inclusions are more effective in membrane shaping than are lipids having a high propensity for curvature. Our computations provide experimentally testable predictions on the protein amounts needed to generate intracellular membrane shapes for various insertion depths and membrane thicknesses. We also predict that the ability of N-BAR domains to produce membrane tubules in vivo can be ascribed solely to insertion of their amphipathic helices. 10.1529/biophysj.108.133173},

Significant interest in these compounds has been demonstrated by environmental, bioremediation, oil, petroleum, food, beverage, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries attracted by their low toxicity, biodegradability and sustainable production technologies. Despite having significant potentials associated with emulsion formation, stabilization, antiadhesive and antimicrobial activities, significantly less output and applications have been reported in food industry. This has been exacerbated by uneconomical or uncompetitive costing issues for their production when compared to plant or chemical counterparts. In this review, biosurfactants properties, present uses and potential future applications as food additives acting as thickening, emulsifying, dispersing or stabilising agents in addition to the use of sustainable economic processes utilising agro-industrial wastes as alternative substrates for their production are discussed. {\copyright} 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

  abstract    = {Allosteric regulation of protein function is recognized to be widespread throughout biology; however, knowledge of allosteric mechanisms, the molecular changes within a protein that couple one binding site to another, is limited. Although mutagenesis is often used to probe allosteric mechanisms, we consider herein what the outcome of a mutagenesis study truly reveals about an allosteric mechanism. Arguably, the best way to evaluate the effects of a mutation on allostery is to monitor the allosteric coupling constant (Qax), a ratio of the substrate binding constants in the absence versus presence of an allosteric effector. A range of substitutions at a given residue position in a protein can reveal when a particular substitution causes gain-of-function, which addresses a key challenge in interpreting mutation-dependent changes in the magnitude of Qax. Thus, whole-protein mutagenesis studies offer an acceptable means of identifying residues that contribute to an allosteric mechanism. With this focus on monitoring Qax, and keeping in mind the equilibrium nature of allostery, we consider alternative possibilities for what an allosteric mechanism might be. We conclude that different possible mechanisms (rotation-of-solid-domains, movement of secondary structure, side-chain repacking, changes in dynamics, etc.) will result in different findings in whole-protein mutagenesis studies.},

  Abstract                 = {The transmembrane (TM) domain of the M2 channel protein from influenza A is a homotetrameric bundle of alpha-helices and provides a model system for computational approaches to self-assembly of membrane proteins. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations have been used to explore partitioning into a membrane of M2 TM helices during bilayer self-assembly from lipids. CG-MD is also used to explore tetramerization of preinserted M2 TM helices. The M2 helix monomer adopts a membrane spanning orientation in a lipid (DPPC) bilayer. Multiple extended CG-MD simulations (5 x 5 micros) were used to study the tetramerization of inserted M2 helices. The resultant tetramers were evaluated in terms of the most populated conformations and the dynamics of their interconversion. This analysis reveals that the M2 tetramer has 2x rotationally symmetrical packing of the helices. The helices form a left-handed bundle, with a helix tilt angle of approximately 16 degrees. The M2 helix bundle generated by CG-MD was converted to an atomistic model. Simulations of this model reveal that the bundle's stability depends on the assumed protonation state of the H37 side chains. These simulations alongside comparison with recent x-ray (3BKD) and NMR (2RLF) structures of the M2 bundle suggest that the model yielded by CG-MD may correspond to a closed state of the channel.},

A range of spectroscopic, microscopic and X-ray scattering methods is used to probe the secondary structure, aggregate morphology and the nanostructure. Peptide amphiphile (PA) C16-KTTKS forms flat tapes and extended fibrillar structures with high ?-sheet content. In contrast, C16-KT and C16-GHK exhibit crystal-like aggregates with, in the case of the latter PA, lower ?-sheet content. All three PA samples show spacings from bilayer structures in small-angle X-ray scattering profiles, and all three have similar critical aggregation concentrations, this being governed by the lipid chain length. However, only C16-KTTKS is stained by Congo red, a diagnostic dye used to detect amyloid formation, and this PA also shows a highly aligned cross-? X-ray diffraction pattern consistent with the high ?-sheet content in the self-assembled aggregates. These findings may provide important insights relevant to the role of self-assembled aggregates on the reported collagen-stimulating properties of these PAs.},

  Abstract                 = {In the absence of external stress, the surface tension of a lipid membrane vanishes at equilibrium, and the membrane exhibits long wavelength undulations that can be described as elastic (as opposed to tension-dominated) deformations. These long wavelength fluctuations are generally suppressed in molecular dynamics simulations of membranes, which have typically been carried out on membrane patches with areas <100 nm2 that are replicated by periodic boundary conditions. As a result, finite system-size effects in molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers have been subject to much discussion in the membrane simulation community for several years, and it has been argued that it is necessary to simulate small membrane patches under tension to properly model the tension-free state of macroscopic membranes. Recent hardware and software advances have made it possible to simulate larger, all-atom systems allowing us to directly address the question of whether the relatively small size of current membrane simulations affects their physical characteristics compared to real macroscopic bilayer systems. In this work, system-size effects on the structure of a DOPC bilayer at 5.4 H2O/lipid are investigated by performing molecular dynamics simulations at constant temperature and isotropic pressure (i.e., vanishing surface tension) of small and large single bilayer patches (72 and 288 lipids, respectively), as well as an explicitly multilamellar system consisting of a stack of five 72-lipid bilayers, all replicated in three dimensions by using periodic boundary conditions. The simulation results are compared to X-ray and neutron diffraction data by using a model-free, reciprocal space approach developed recently in our laboratories. Our analysis demonstrates that finite-size effects are negligible in simulations of DOPC bilayers at low hydration, and suggests that refinements are needed in the simulation force fields.},

Upon binding, LTB4 adopts a highly constrained seahorse conformation, at variance with the free state, where it explores a wide range of conformations. This structure provides an experimentally determined template of a pro-inflammatory compound for further pharmacological studies.

When long simulations are run in many segments, it is sometimes possible to have a repeating sequence of pseudorandom numbers enter the calcuation. We show that, if the sequence repeats rapidly, the resulting artifacts can quickly denature biomolecules and are then easily detectable. However, if the sequence repeats less frequently, the artifacts become subtle and easily overlooked. We derive a formula for the underlying cause of artifacts in the case of the Langevin thermostat, and find it vanishes slowly as the inverse square root of the number of time steps per simulation segment. Numerous examples of simulation artifacts are presented, including dissociation of a tetrameric protein after 110 ns of dynamics, reductions in atomic fluctuations for a small protein in implicit solvent, altered thermodynamic properties of a box of water molecules, and changes in the transition free energies between dihedral angle conformations. Finally, in the case of strong thermocoupling, we link the observed artifacts to previous work in nonlinear dynamics and show that it is possible to drive a 20-residue, implicitly solvated protein into periodic trajectories if the thermostat is not used properly. Our findings should help other investigators re-evaluate simulations that may have been corrupted and obtain more accurate results.},

  Abstract                 = {Rhodopsin, the first purified G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), was characterized as a functional monomer 30 year ago, but dimerization of GPCRs recently became the new paradigm of signal transduction. It has even been claimed, on the basis of recent biophysical and biochemical studies, that this new concept could be extended to higher-order oligomerization. Here this view is challenged. The new studies of rhodopsin and other simple (class 1a) GPCRs solubilized in detergent are re-assessed and are compared to the earlier classical studies of rhodopsin and other membrane proteins solubilized in detergent. The new studies are found to strengthen rather than invalidate the conclusions of the early ones and to support a monomeric model for rhodopsin and other class 1a GPCRs. A molecular model is proposed for the functional coupling of a rhodopsin monomeric unit with a G-protein heterotrimer. This model should be valid even for GPCRs that exist as structural dimers.},

  Abstract                 = {Human beta defensin-3 (HBD-3) is a unique potent antimicrobial peptide. To explore the importance of the three-dimensional structure of HBD-3 in its activity and selectivity, we have mutated all six cysteine residues of HBD-3 to other amino acids, expressed the mutant (named as Def-A) in Escherichia coli, and analyzed the mutant's activity, structure, and dynamics. Def-A is active against several bacterial strains, but the activity is influenced by the ionic strength of the environment. When subjected to vesicles like POPG or to micelles like SDS, Def-A is changed from a random coil structure to an ordered helical form. We have determined the structure of Def-A in SDS micelle and found that it is folded into two distinct helices separated by a proline kink. We propose that the long N-terminal helix with many hydrophobic residues is inserted inside the micelle while the C-terminal helix with one large positive charge patch is located outside the micelle and interacts with the charged head groups of the micelle. The model is supported by NMR relaxation and H-D exchange data. Our results indicate that in addition to the number of positively charged residues and hydrophobic residues, the arrangement of these residues in the three-dimensional space is important to the antimicrobial selectivity and salt-dependent activity of human beta defensins.},

We have now purified each form of TSHR-289 using sequential affinity chromatography with a mouse mAb (3BD10) specific for the inactive form, and a mAb to C-terminal His residues that recognizes both forms. The immunological difference between active and inactive TSHR-289 was unrelated to primary amino acid sequence or carbohydrate content and was, therefore, attributable to its folded state. The epitopes for Graves' autoantibodies and 3BD10 overlap, and both are destroyed by denaturation. Therefore, reciprocal binding by autoantibodies and 3BD10 to conformational determinants involving the same TSHR segment suggests a prion-like shift between two folded states of the molecule. Despite purification, immunologically active TSHR-289 remained labile, as determined by loss of autoantibody, and gain of 3BD10, recognition. However, using chemical chaperones we have, for the first time, been able to stabilize purified TSHR antigen in immunologically intact form. In summary, purification of immunologically active and stable antigen in milligram quantities provides a powerful tool for future diagnostic and therapeutic studies in Graves' disease.},

  Abstract                 = {The phase behavior of mixtures of cholesterol or epicholesterol with phosphatidylethanolamine was studied by differential scanning calorimetry and by X-ray diffraction. Discrete domains of cholesterol are detected by X-ray diffraction in the L alpha phase of phosphatidylethanolamine from egg yolk and synthetic dielaidoylphosphatidylethanolamine beginning at mole fractions of 0.35-0.4 cholesterol. Separate domains of crystalline epicholesterol can also be detected in the L alpha phase of dielaidoylphosphatidylethanolamine by X-ray diffraction at as little as 0.16 mole fraction of epicholesterol. This is a result of poor miscibility of the epicholesterol with dielaidoylphosphatidylethanolamine. Epicholesterol does not alter the L beta----L alpha transition or bilayer spacing. Epicholesterol also has little effect on the diameter of the cylinders in the hexagonal phase. Formation of the inverted hexagonal phase is facilitated by addition of small amounts of cholesterol (mole fraction less than 0.2) in both egg phosphatidylethanolamine and dielaidoylphosphatidylethanolamine. However, at higher mole fractions of cholesterol, the stability of the liquid-crystalline phase is found to increase markedly for dielaidoylphosphatidylethanolamine but not for egg phosphatidylethanolamine, indicating the importance of the structure of the acyl chains in controlling the relative stability of the lamellar and nonlamellar phases in these systems. In contrast to cholesterol, epicholesterol markedly lowers the L alpha----HII phase transition temperature at low mole fraction of sterol. This result demonstrates the importance of the orientation and motional properties of an additive in determining the L alpha----HII transition temperature.},

Data obtained from ATR-IR spectroscopy, detergent solubility and zeta potential measurements show that the insertion of the various sterols alters the packing arrangement of the tails and headgroup of the PC lipids and may lead to lipid domain formation. On a molecular basis, the differences in lipid packing architecture are traced to differences between the ring and tail structure of the three sterols and these differences in structure produce different effects in DPPC liposomes in the gel phase and EggPC liposomes in the fluid phase. Specifically, CHOL has a relatively flat and linear structure and among the three sterols, shows the strongest molecular interactions with DPPC and EggPC lipids. An extra double bond in the fused ring of 7DHC hinders a tightly packing arrangement with DPPC lipids and leads to less domain formation than CHOL whereas 7DHC clearly produces more lipid domain formation in EggPC. ERGO produces similar structural changes to 7DHC in the tail and headgroup region of DPPC. Nevertheless, ERGO incorporation into DPPC liposomes produces more domain formation than 7DHC.},

The aim of this paper is to isolate and identify these antibiotics.The antagonistic activity of JA was tested in vitro; it exhibited strong inhibition against some important phytopathogens and postharvest pathogens. Crude antibiotic production was extracted with methanol from the precipitate by adding 6 mol l(-1) HCl to the bacillus-free culture broth. The crude extract was run on Diamonsil C18 column (5 microm, 250 x 4.6 mm) in HPLC system to separate the antibiotics. Major antibiotics were classified into three lipopeptide families according to electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry analysis. Subsequently, the classification of antibiotics was confirmed with typical collision-induced dissociation fragments.Three kinds of antibiotics were isolated from B. subtilis JA and were identified to the lipopeptide families, surfactin, iturin and fengycin. These compounds could function as biocontrol agents against a large spectrum of pathogens.This study provided a reliable and rapid method for isolation and structural characterization of lipopeptide antibiotics from B. subtilis.},

  Abstract                 = {Implicit solvent-based methods play an increasingly important role in molecular modeling of biomolecular structure and dynamics. Recent methodological developments have mainly focused on the extension of the generalized Born (GB) formalism for variable dielectric environments and accurate treatment of nonpolar solvation. Extensive efforts in parameterization of GB models and implicit solvent force fields have enabled ab initio simulation of protein folding to native or near-native structures. Another exciting area that has benefited from the advances in implicit solvent models is the development of constant pH molecular dynamics methods, which have recently been applied to the calculations of protein pK(a) values and the studies of pH-dependent peptide and protein folding.},

  abstract             = {A hierarchical simulation framework that integrates information from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations into a continuum model is established to study the mechanical response of mechanosensitive channel of large-conductance (MscL) using the finite element method (FEM). The proposed MD-decorated FEM (MDeFEM) approach is used to explore the detailed gating mechanisms of the MscL in Escherichia coli embedded in a palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine lipid bilayer. In Part I of this study, the framework of MDeFEM is established. The transmembrane and cytoplasmic helices are taken to be elastic rods, the loops are modeled as springs, and the lipid bilayer is approximated by a three-layer sheet. The mechanical properties of the continuum components, as well as their interactions, are derived from molecular simulations based on atomic force fields. In addition, analytical closed-form continuum model and elastic network model are established to complement the MDeFEM approach and to capture the most essential features of gating. In Part II of this study, the detailed gating mechanisms of E. coli-MscL under various types of loading are presented and compared with experiments, structural model, and all-atom simulations, as well as the analytical models established in Part I. It is envisioned that such a hierarchical multiscale framework will find great value in the study of a variety of biological processes involving complex mechanical deformations such as muscle contraction and mechanotransduction. 10.1529/biophysj.107.128488},

  abstract        = {Inherent instability of the P23H mutant opsin accounts for approximately 10% of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa cases. Our purpose was to develop an overall set of reliable screening strategies to assess if either stabilization or enhanced degradation of mutant rhodopsin could rescue rod photoreceptors expressing this mutant protein. These strategies promise to reveal active compounds and clarify molecular mechanisms of biologically important processes, such as inhibition of target degradation or enhanced target folding. Cell-based bioluminescence reporter assays were developed and validated for high-throughput screening (HTS) of compounds that promote either stabilization or degradation of P23H mutant opsin. Such assays were further complemented by immunoblotting and image-based analyses. Two stabilization assays of P23H mutant opsin were developed and validated, one based on Î²-galactosidase complementarity and a second assay involving bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technology. Moreover, two additional assays evaluating mutant protein degradation also were employed, one based on the disappearance of luminescence and another employing the ALPHA immunoassay. Imaging of cells revealed the cellular localization of mutant rhodopsin, whereas immunoblots identified changes in the aggregation and glycosylation of P23H mutant opsin. Our findings indicate that these initial HTS and following assays can identify active therapeutic compounds, even for difficult targets such as mutant rhodopsin. The assays are readily scalable and their function has been proven with model compounds. High-throughput screening, supported by automated imaging and classic immunoassays, can further characterize multiple steps and pathways in the biosynthesis and degradation of this essential visual system protein.},

  abstract             = {The effects of hydrophobic thickness and the molar phosphatidylglycerol (PG) content of lipid bilayers on the structure and membrane interaction of three cationic antimicrobial peptides were examined: aurein 2.2, aurein 2.3 (almost identical to aurein 2.2, except for a point mutation at residue 13), and a carboxy C-terminal analog of aurein 2.3. Circular dichroism results indicated that all three peptides adopt an -helical structure in the presence of a 3:1 molar mixture of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (DMPC/DMPG), and 1:1 and 3:1 molar mixtures of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-rac-(1-glycerol)] (POPC/POPG). Oriented circular dichroism data for three different lipid compositions showed that all three peptides were surface-adsorbed at low peptide concentrations, but were inserted into the membrane at higher peptide concentrations. The 31P solid-state NMR data of the three peptides in the DMPC/DMPG and POPC/POPG bilayers showed that all three peptides significantly perturbed lipid headgroups, in a peptide or lipid composition-dependent manner. Differential scanning calorimetry results demonstrated that both amidated aurein peptides perturbed the overall phase structure of DMPC/DMPG bilayers, but perturbed the POPC/POPG chains less. The nature of the perturbation of DMPC/DMPG bilayers was most likely micellization, and for the POPC/POPG bilayers, distorted toroidal pores or localized membrane aggregate formation. Calcein release assay results showed that aurein peptide-induced membrane leakage was more severe in DMPC/DMPG liposomes than in POPC/POPG liposomes, and that aurein 2.2 induced higher calcein release than aurein 2.3 and aurein 2.3-COOH from 1:1 and 3:1 POPC/POPG liposomes. Finally, DiSC35 assay data further delineated aurein 2.2 from the others by showing that it perturbed the lipid membranes of intact S. aureus C622 most efficiently, whereas aurein 2.3 had the same efficiency as gramicidin S, and aurein 2.3-COOH wasthe least efficient. Taken together, these data show that the membrane interactions of aurein peptides are affected bythe hydrophobic thickness of the lipid bilayers and the PG content.},

  Abstract                 = {NMR observables, such as NOE-based distance measurements, are increasingly being used to characterize membrane protein structures. However, challenges in membrane protein NMR studies often yield a relatively small number of such restraints that can create ambiguities in defining critical side chain-side chain interactions. In the recent solution NMR structure of the DAP12-NKG2C immunoreceptor transmembrane helix complex, five functionally required interfacial residues (two Asps and two Thrs in the DAP12 dimer and one Lys in NKG2C) display a surprising arrangement in which one Asp side chain faces the membrane hydrophobic core. To explore whether these side-chain interactions are energetically optimal, we used the published distance restraints for molecular dynamics simulations in explicit micelles and bilayers. The structures refined by this protocol are globally similar to the published structure, but the side chains of those five residues form a stable network of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, leaving the Asp side chain shielded from the hydrophobic core, which is also consistent with available experimental observations. Moreover, the simulations show similar short-range interactions between the transmembrane complex and lipid/detergent molecules in micelles and bilayers, respectively. This study illustrates the efficacy of NMR membrane protein structure refinements in explicit membrane systems.},

As a representative protein/micelle model, Pf1 coat protein is modeled and simulated in DHPC micelles with three different numbers of DHPC molecules. While the number of DHPC molecules in direct contact with Pf1 protein converges during the simulation, distinct behavior and geometry of micelles lead to different protein conformations in comparison to that in bilayers. It is our hope that CHARMM-GUI Micelle Builder can be used for simulation studies of various protein/micelle systems to better understand the protein structure and dynamics in micelles as well as distribution of detergents and their dynamics around proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {As time- and ensemble-averaged measures, NMR observables contain information about both protein structure and dynamics. This work represents a computational study to extract such information for membrane proteins from orientation-dependent NMR observables: solid-state NMR chemical shift anisotropy and dipolar coupling, and solution NMR residual dipolar coupling. We have performed NMR-restrained molecular dynamics simulations to refine the structure of the membrane-bound form of Pf1 coat protein in explicit lipid bilayers using the recently measured chemical shift anisotropy, dipolar coupling, and residual dipolar coupling data. From the simulations, we have characterized detailed protein-lipid interactions and explored the dynamics. All simulations are stable and the NMR restraints are well satisfied. The C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain of Pf1 finds its optimal position in the membrane quickly (within 6 ns), illustrating efficient solvation of TM domains in explicit bilayer environments. Such rapid convergence also leads to well-converged interaction patterns between the TM helix and the membrane, which clearly show the interactions of interfacial membrane-anchoring residues with the lipids. For the N-terminal periplasmic helix of Pf1, we identify a stable, albeit dynamic, helix orientation parallel to the membrane surface that satisfies the amphiphatic nature of the helix in an explicit lipid bilayer. Such detailed information cannot be obtained solely from NMR observables. Therefore, the present simulations illustrate the usefulness of NMR-restrained MD refinement of membrane protein structure in explicit membranes.},

  Abstract                 = {With advances in structure genomics, it is now recognized that knowledge of structure alone is insufficient to understand and control the mechanisms of biomolecular function. Additional information in the form of dynamics is needed. As demonstrated in a large number of studies, the machinery of proteins and their complexes can be understood to a good approximation by adopting Gaussian (or elastic) network models (GNM) for simplified normal mode analyses. While this approximation lacks chemical details, it provides us with a means for assessing the collective motions of large structures/assemblies and perform a comparative analysis of a series of proteins, thus providing insights into the mechanical aspects of biomolecular dynamics. In this paper, we discuss recent applications of GNM to a series of enzymes as well as large structures such as the HK97 bacteriophage viral capsids. Understanding the dynamics of large protein structures can be computationally challenging. To this end, we introduce a new approach for building a hierarchical, reduced rank representation of the protein topology and consequently the fluctuation dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite significant efforts toward understanding the molecular basis of allosteric communication, the mechanisms by which local energetic and conformational changes cooperatively diffuse from ligand-binding sites to distal regions across the 3-dimensional structure of allosteric proteins remain to be established. Recent experimental and theoretical evidence supports the view that allosteric communication is facilitated by the intrinsic ability of the biomolecules to undergo collective changes in structure, triggered by ligand binding. Two groups of studies recently proved to provide insights into such intrinsic, structure-induced effects: elastic network models that permit us to visualize the cooperative changes in conformation that are most readily accessible near native state conditions, and information-theoretic approaches that elucidate the most efficient pathways of signal transmission favored by the overall architecture. Using a combination of these two approaches, we highlight, by way of application to the bacterial chaperonin complex GroEL-GroES, how the most cooperative modes of motion play a role in mediating the propagation of allosteric signals. A functional coupling between the global dynamics sampled under equilibrium conditions and the signal transduction pathways inherently favored by network topology appears to control allosteric effects.},

  Abstract                 = {Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors constitute the largest family of eukaryotic signal transduction proteins that communicate across the membrane. We report the crystal structure of a human beta2-adrenergic receptor-T4 lysozyme fusion protein bound to the partial inverse agonist carazolol at 2.4 angstrom resolution. The structure provides a high-resolution view of a human G protein-coupled receptor bound to a diffusible ligand. Ligand-binding site accessibility is enabled by the second extracellular loop, which is held out of the binding cavity by a pair of closely spaced disulfide bridges and a short helical segment within the loop. Cholesterol, a necessary component for crystallization, mediates an intriguing parallel association of receptor molecules in the crystal lattice. Although the location of carazolol in the beta2-adrenergic receptor is very similar to that of retinal in rhodopsin, structural differences in the ligand-binding site and other regions highlight the challenges in using rhodopsin as a template model for this large receptor family.},

Recently, we developed a high-throughput computational approach for the prediction of membrane protein/lipid interactions. In the current study, we enhanced this approach with the addition of a new measure of the distortion caused by membrane proteins on a lipid bilayer. This is illustrated by considering the effect of lipid tail length and headgroup charge on the distortion caused by the integral membrane proteins MscS and FLAP, and by the voltage sensing domain from the channel KvAP. Changing the chain length of lipids alters the extent but not the pattern of distortion caused by MscS and FLAP; lipid headgroups distort in order to interact with very similar but not identical regions in these proteins for all bilayer widths investigated. Introducing anionic lipids into a DPPC bilayer containing the KvAP voltage sensor does not affect the extent of bilayer distortion.},

The crystal structure of the human dopamine D3 receptor (D3R) in complex with the small molecule D2R/D3R-specific antagonist eticlopride reveals important features of the ligand binding pocket and extracellular loops. On the intracellular side of the receptor, a locked conformation of the ionic lock and two distinctly different conformations of intracellular loop 2 are observed. Docking of R-22, a D3R-selective antagonist, reveals an extracellular extension of the eticlopride binding site that comprises a second binding pocket for the aryl amide of R-22, which differs between the highly homologous D2R and D3R. This difference provides direction to the design of D3R-selective agents for treating drug abuse and other neuropsychiatric indications.},

Some parameters from the earlier 43A1 force field are found to be correct in the context of these calculations, while others are modified. The validity of the force fields is demonstrated by correct replication of X-ray form factors and NMR order parameters over a wide range of membrane compositions in semi-isotropic NTP 1 atm simulations. 43-A1-S3 compares favorably with other force fields used in conjunction with the Gromacs simulation package with respect to the breadth of phenomena that it accurately reproduces.},

  abstract =    {The widespread popularity of replica exchange and expanded ensemble algorithms for simulating complex molecular systems in chemistry and biophysics has generated much interest in discovering new ways to enhance the phase space mixing of these protocols in order to improve sampling of uncorrelated configurations. Here, we demonstrate how both of these classes of algorithms can be considered as special cases of Gibbs sampling within a Markov chain Monte Carlo framework. Gibbs sampling is a well-studied scheme in the field of statistical inference in which different random variables are alternately updated from conditional distributions. While the update of the conformational degrees of freedom by Metropolis Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics unavoidably generates correlated samples, we show how judicious updating of the thermodynamic state indices--corresponding to thermodynamic parameters such as temperature or alchemical coupling variables--can substantially increase mixing while still sampling from the desired distributions. We show how state update methods in common use can lead to suboptimal mixing, and present some simple, inexpensive alternatives that can increase mixing of the overall Markov chain, reducing simulation times necessary to obtain estimates of the desired precision. These improved schemes are demonstrated for several common applications, including an alchemical expanded ensemble simulation, parallel tempering, and multidimensional replica exchange umbrella sampling.},

  abstract =    {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are seven transmembrane helix (TM) proteins that transduce signals into living cells by binding extracellular ligands and coupling to intracellular heterotrimeric G proteins (GÎ±Î²Î³). The photoreceptor rhodopsin couples to transducin and bears its ligand 11-cis-retinal covalently bound via a protonated Schiff base to the opsin apoprotein. Absorption of a photon causes retinal cis/trans isomerization and generates the agonist all-trans-retinal in situ. After early photoproducts, the active G-protein-binding intermediate metarhodopsin II (MetaâII) is formed, in which the retinal Schiff base is still intact but deprotonated. Dissociation of the proton from the Schiff base breaks a major constraint in the protein and enables further activating steps, including an outward tilt of TM6 and formation of a large cytoplasmic crevice for uptake of the interacting C terminus of the GÎ± subunit. Owing to Schiff base hydrolysis, MetaâII is short-lived and notoriously difficult to crystallize. We therefore soaked opsin crystals with all-trans-retinal to form MetaâII, presuming that the crystal's high concentration of opsin in an active conformation (Ops*) may facilitate all-trans-retinal uptake and Schiff base formation. Here we present the 3.0âÃ and 2.85âÃ crystal structures, respectively, of MetaâII alone or in complex with an 11-amino-acid C-terminal fragment derived from GÎ± (GÎ±CT2). GÎ±CT2 binds in a large crevice at the cytoplasmic side, akin to the binding of a similar GÎ±-derived peptide to Ops* (ref. 7). In the MetaâII structures, the electron density from the retinal ligand seamlessly continues into the Lysâ296 side chain, reflecting proper formation of the Schiff base linkage. The retinal is in a relaxed conformation and almost undistorted compared with pure crystalline all-trans-retinal. By comparison with early photoproducts we propose how retinal translocation and rotation induce the gross conformational changes characteristic for MetaâII. The structures can now serve as models for the large GPCR family.},

  Abstract                 = {Allergic upper airway diseases such as allergic rhinitis and chronic sinusitis are an increasing problem. Although the pathogenesis remains elusive, an individual's genetic predisposition as well as exposure to the allergen are currently considered factors in their development. Clinical symptoms of sneezing, rhinorrhea, and congestion are primarily a consequence of granulocyte release of chemical mediators such as histamine, prostanoids, and leukotrienes as well as the infiltration of inflammatory cells. Observations subsequent to allergen provocation are comparable to natural exposure and as such much of our understanding of allergic responses is derived from this model. A prominence of CD4(+) T cells and eosinophils, synthesis and release of T(H)2 cytokines, and the coordinate expression of chemokines and adhesion molecules are all characteristic of the allergic response observed in rhinitis and sinusitis. Corticosteroids and immunotherapy target these inflammatory processes and have been observed to successfully reduce and shift the predominantly T(H)2 environment toward T(H)1 cytokine expression. As our understanding of the pathophysiologic features of allergic upper airway disease improves, as well as the relationship between their development and that of lower airway disease, new strategies of diagnosis and treatment will allow for more effective modulation of the allergic process and associated morbidity.},

  abstract        = {G protein-coupled receptors represent the largest family of membrane receptors that instigate signalling through nucleotide exchange on heterotrimeric G proteins. Nucleotide exchange, or more precisely, GDP dissociation from the G protein Î±-subunit, is the key step towards G protein activation and initiation of downstream signalling cascades. Despite a wealth of biochemical and biophysical studies on inactive and active conformations of several heterotrimeric G proteins, the molecular underpinnings of G protein activation remain elusive. To characterize this mechanism, we applied peptide amide hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to probe changes in the structure of the heterotrimeric bovine G protein, Gs (the stimulatory G protein for adenylyl cyclase) on formation of a complex with agonist-bound human Î²(2) adrenergic receptor (Î²(2)AR). Here we report structural links between the receptor-binding surface and the nucleotide-binding pocket of Gs that undergo higher levels of hydrogen-deuterium exchange than would be predicted from the crystal structure of the Î²(2)AR-Gs complex. Together with X-ray crystallographic and electron microscopic data of the Î²(2)AR-Gs complex (from refs 2, 3), we provide a rationale for a mechanism of nucleotide exchange, whereby the receptor perturbs the structure of the amino-terminal region of the Î±-subunit of Gs and consequently alters the 'P-loop' that binds the Î²-phosphate in GDP. As with the Ras family of small-molecular-weight G proteins, P-loop stabilization and Î²-phosphate coordination are key determinants of GDP (and GTP) binding affinity.},

The purified 31 kDa protein was subjected to N-glycan enzymatic digestion for structural analysis. The relative electrophoretic mobility was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, before and after digestion. On SDS-PAGE after enzymatic digestion, the 31 kDa protein showed a molecular shift of approximately 2 kDa, which indicated the possession of complex N-linked oligosaccharides (N-glycosidase F sensitive) but not of high-mannose oligosaccharides (endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, non-sensitive). Chemically periodated 31 kDa protein showed statistically non-significant changes with human sparganosis sera by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Therefore, the dominant epitopes of the 31 kDa molecule in human sparganosis were found to be mainly polypeptide, while N-glycans of the antigenic molecule in sparganum was minimal in anti-carbohydrate antibody production.},

  annotation = {The hierarchical properties of potential energy landscapes have been used to gain insight into thermodynamic and kinetic properties of protein ensembles. It also may be possible to use them to direct computational searches for thermodynamically stable macroscopic states, i.e., computational protein folding. To this end, we have developed a top-down search procedure in which conformation space is recursively dissected according to the intrinsic hierarchical structure of a landscape's effective-energy barriers, This procedure generates an inverted tree similar to the disconnectivity graphs generated by local minima-clustering methods, but it fundamentally differs in the manner in which the portion of the tree that is to be computationally explored is selected. A key ingredient is a branch-selection algorithm that takes advantage of statistically predictive properties of the landscape to guide searches down the tree branches that are most likely to lead to the physically relevant macroscopic states. Using the computational folding of a beta -hairpin-forming peptide as an example, we show that such predictive properties indeed exist and can be used for structure prediction by free-energy global minimization.},

F., and Pokorny, A. (2009) Biochemistry 48, 8083-8093]. Two sets of peptides were designed to test those hypotheses, by mutating of the sequences of Î´-lysin, cecropin A, and magainin 2. Peptide binding and activity were measured on phosphatidylcholine membranes. In the first set, the peptide charge was changed by mutating basic to acidic residues or vice versa, but the amino acid sequence was not altered much otherwise. The type of dye release changed from graded to all-or-none according to prediction. However, location of charged residues in the sequence with the correct spacing to form salt bridges failed to improve binding. In the second set, the charged and other key residues were kept in the same positions, whereas most of the sequence was significantly but conservatively simplified, maintaining the same hydrophobicity and amphipathicity. This set behaved completely different from predicted. The type of release, which was expected to be maintained, changed dramatically from all-or-none to graded in the mutants of cecropin and magainin. Finally, contrary to the hypotheses, the results indicate that the Gibbs energy of binding to the membrane, not the Gibbs energy of insertion, is the primary determinant of peptide activity.},

To investigate the extent of the topological control of the folding process, we studied the folding of simplified models of five small globular proteins constructed using a Go-like potential to retain the information about the native structures but drastically reduce the energetic frustration and energetic heterogeneity among residue-residue native interactions. By comparing the structure of the transition state ensemble (experimentally determined by Phi-values) and of the intermediates with those obtained using our models, we show that these energetically unfrustrated models can reproduce the global experimentally known features of the transition state ensembles and "en-route" intermediates, at least for the analyzed proteins. This result clearly indicates that, as long as the protein sequence is sufficiently minimally frustrated, topology plays a central role in determining the folding mechanism.},

According to the CD results, lipophilin retained at least 60\% of organized secondary structure in 8 M urea and 6 M GdmCl (measurements were not possible in GdmSCN). This partial denaturation was of a complex, irreversible nature, and was not appreciably enhanced by prolonged incubation (8 days), by heating to 70 degrees C, by disulfide bond reduction, or by pH variation in the range pH 1.5 to 11. Fluorescence studies demonstrated that the tryptophan residues were only slightly perturbed by 8 M and 6 M GdmCl and remained well buried to the permeant quenching agent acrylamide. A greater, but still far from complete, disruption of lipophilin was achieved in 6 M GdmSCN, and fluorescence polarization provided evidence for some form of cooperative structural change induced by increasing concentrations of this reagent. Transfer of the protein from 2-chloroethanol, in which the tryptophan residues are fully exposed, into 6 M GdmSCN by dialysis resulted in reburial of the fluorophores owing to development of tertiary structure. The combined evidence suggests that the extraordinary resistance of lipophilin to these denaturants is due to the presence of an impervious hydrophobic core. In lipophilin and some other membrane-associated proteins, extended sequences of apolar residues might provide the nuclei for such structural domains.},

  Abstract                 = {Ellman's reagent was used to investigate the status and exposure of the cysteinyl residues in lipophilin, a proteolipid apoprotein from human myelin. The hydrolyzed protein contained 3.5 to 4.5 cysteines per molecule, which increased to 11 after complete reduction. The native protein was thought to contain three disulfide bonds and five free sulfhydryl groups, which undergo partial oxidation during purification. Exposure of -SH groups in the aqueous protein was minimal, even in the presence of 6 M guanidinium chloride, suggesting a location in hydrophobic domains not disrupted by this reagent. In the helicogenic solvent 2-chloroethanol, the full complement of -SH groups could not be revealed, even with the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate; a difference of two sulfhydryls between intact and hydrolyzed protein was consistently observed. Similar sulfhydryl reactivity toward iodoacetamide was also established in this solvent. Sulfhydryl assays on whole myelin in 2-chloroethanol indicated that the occurrence of -SH groups in the proteolipid component was at least as high as in the purified apoprotein. Lipophilin was reduced and alkylated with 4-vinylpyridine at 10 of its cysteinyl residues. The modified protein adopted a beta structure under conditions where lipophilin is normally highly alpha-helical, and was also less helical than usual in 2-chloroethanol; however, it was still abnormally resistant to denaturation by guanidinium chloride. Modified lipophilin contained as many ester groups as the intact protein; thus, it appeared unlikely that the long chain fatty acids associated with the protein were attached to cysteine residues.},

  abstract =    {In previous studies, mutation of either Lys296 or Glu113 in bovine rhodopsin has been shown to result in constitutive activation of the apoprotein form, opsin [Robinson et al. (1992) Neuron 9, 719-725]. In this report, pH-rate profiles for the rhodopsin-catalyzed exchange of GTPgS for GDP on transducin are established for the constitutively active opsin mutants. All of the mutants, including the double-mutant E113Q,K296G, show a bell-shaped pH-rate profile. Therefore, it is evident that at least two ionizable groups in addition to Lys296 and Glu113 control the formation of the active opsin state. The sole effect of mutation at position 113 or 296 is to alter the ionization constant of the group with the higher pKa, called pka2. pKa2 decreases in the following order: rhodopsin/light (9.0) > K296E = K296G = E113Q,K296G (8.0) > E113Q (6.8) > K296H (6.6) > wild-type opsin (< 5.0). These results are consistent with a model where activation of opsin involves (i) breaking of the salt bridge between Lys296 and Glu113, (ii) deprotonation of Lys296, and (iii) the net uptake of a proton from the solvent. Furthermore, exogenous addition of the chromophore all-trans-retinal shifts the wild-type and E113Q opsin equilibrium to favor the active state. In all these respects, the light-independent activation of the opsin mutants appears to proceed by a mechanism similar to that of light-activated rhodopsin.},

The DW method allows the observation at high magnetic field gradient values of only the slow-moving (intracellular) components, thus ensuring complete separation between intra- and extracellular components. Using the chemical shift difference (deltadelta) between the imidazole ring C2-H and C4(5)-H peaks, we were able to measure the pHi independently of chemical shift standardization. With His, the cell lines gave pHi values of approximately 6.5-7.0, whereas with Im, a second, more acidic compartment (pHi = 5.5-5.8) was also observed. An inverse correlation was also found between pHi and the intracellular lactate concentration. This method may be applicable to in vivo pH determinations.},

The problem is hard to solve for large molecules using general minimization approaches because of the enormous amount of required computation. We therefore propose a build-up process to systematically ``construct'' the optimal molecular structures. A prototype algorithm is designed using the anisotropic effective energy simulated annealing method at each build-up stage. The algorithm has been implemented on the Intel iPSC/860 parallel computer, and tested with the Lennard- Jones microcluster conformation problem. The experiments showed that the algorithm was effective for relatively large test problems, and also very suitable for massively parallel computation. In particular, for the 72-atom Lennard-Jones microcluster, the algorithm found a structure whose energy is lower than any others found in previous studies.},

Four different starting structures were used for r(AAAA), r(CAAU), and r(GACC), while five starting structures were used for r(UUUU). On the basis of X-ray structures, criteria are reported for quantifying stacking. The force fields, AMBER ff99, parmbsc0, parm99Ï_Yil, ff10, and parmTor, all predict experimentally unobserved stacks and intercalations, e.g., base 1 stacked between bases 3 and 4, and incorrect Ï, Ïµ, and sugar pucker populations. The intercalated structures are particularly stable, often lasting several microseconds. Parmbsc0, parm99Ï_Yil, and ff10 give similar agreement with NMR, but the best agreement is only 46\%. Experimentally unobserved intercalations typically are associated with reduced solvent accessible surface area along with amino and hydroxyl hydrogen bonds to phosphate nonbridging oxygens. Results from an extensive set of MD simulations suggest that recent force field parametrizations improve predictions, but further improvements are necessary to provide reasonable agreement with NMR. In particular, intramolecular stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions may not be well balanced with the TIP3P water model. NMR data and the scoring method presented here provide rigorous benchmarks for future changes in force fields and MD methods.},

This enhances hybridization to DNA and RNA, making LNAs useful in microarrays and potential therapeutics. Here, the LNA, L(CAAU), provides a simplified benchmark for testing the ability of molecular dynamics (MD) to approximate nucleic acid properties. LNA Ï torsions and partial charges were parametrized to create AMBER parm99_LNA. The revisions were tested by comparing MD predictions with AMBER parm99 and parm99_LNA against a 200 ms NOESY NMR spectrum of L(CAAU). NMR indicates an A-Form equilibrium ensemble. In 3000 ns simulations starting with an A-form structure, parm99_LNA and parm99 provide 66\% and 35\% agreement, respectively, with NMR NOE volumes and (3)J-couplings. In simulations of L(CAAU) starting with all Ï torsions in a syn conformation, only parm99_LNA is able to repair the structure. This implies methods for parametrizing force fields for nucleic acid mimics can reasonably approximate key interactions and that parm99_LNA will improve reliability of MD studies for systems with LNA. A method for approximating Ï population distribution on the basis of base to sugar NOEs is also introduced.},

We briefly review relevant results from the theory of stochastic processes and discuss the monitoring of convergence to equilibrium, the obtaining of confidence intervals for summary statistics corresponding to measured quantities, and an approach to validation and improvement of simulations based on out-of-sample prediction. We apply these methods to replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) simulations of a set of eight helical peptides under the AMBER potential using implicit solvent. We evaluate the ability of these simulations to quantitatively reproduce experimental helicity measurements obtained by circular dichroism (CD). In addition, we introduce notions of statistical predictive estimation for forcefield parameter refinement. We perform a sensitivity analysis to identify key parameters of the potential, and introduce Bayesian updating of these parameters. We demonstrate the effect of parameter updating applied to the internal dielectric constant parameter on the out-of-sample prediction accuracy as measured by cross-validation. 10.1529/biophysj.108.131623},

Specifically, neural networks are used to predict the secondary structure of a protein, restraints are defined as manifestations of the network with a predicted secondary structure and the secondary structure is formed using local minimizations on a protein energy surface, in the presence of the restraints. Those residues predicted to be coil, by the network, define a conformational sub-space that is subject to optimization using a global approach known as stochastic perturbation that has been found to be effective for Lennard- Jones clusters and homo-polypeptides. Our energy surface is an all-atom 'gas phase' molecular mechanics force field, that is combined with a new solvation energy function that penalizes hydrophobic group exposure. This energy function gives the crystal structure of four different cc-helical proteins as the lowest energy structure relative to other conformations, with correct secondary structure but incorrect tertiary structure. We demonstrate this global optimization strategy by determining the tertiary structure of the A-chain of the cc-helical protein, uteroglobin and of a four-helix bundle, DNA binding protein.

Because the computation can be represented as a search through a vast tree of possible solutions, a hierarchical approach that assigns subtrees to different groups of processors allows us to partition the work efficiently and maintain information updated without incurring significant communication overhead. Our results show that a dynamic strategy for load balancing outperforms the static one.},

  Abstract                 = {Isomerization of the 11-cis retinal chromophore in the visual pigment rhodopsin is coupled to motion of transmembrane helix H6 and receptor activation. We present solid-state magic angle spinning NMR measurements of rhodopsin and the metarhodopsin II intermediate that support the proposal that interaction of Trp265(6.48) with the retinal chromophore is responsible for stabilizing an inactive conformation in the dark, and that motion of the beta-ionone ring allows Trp265(6.48) and transmembrane helix H6 to adopt active conformations in the light. Two-dimensional dipolar-assisted rotational resonance NMR measurements are made between the C19 and C20-methyl groups of the retinal and uniformly 13C-labeled Trp265(6.48). The retinal C20-Trp265(6.48) contact present in the dark-state of rhodopsin is lost in metarhodopsin II, and a new contact is formed with the C19 methyl group. We have previously shown that the retinal translates 4-5 A toward H5 in metarhodopsin II. This motion, in conjunction with the Trp-C19 contact, implies that the Trp265(6.48) side-chain moves significantly upon rhodopsin activation. NMR measurements also show that a packing interaction in rhodopsin between Trp265(6.48) and Gly121(3.36) is lost in metarhodopsin II, consistent with H6 motion away from H3. However, a close contact between Gly120(3.35) on H3 and Met86(2.53) on H2 is observed in both rhodopsin and metarhodopsin II, suggesting that H3 does not change orientation significantly upon receptor activation.},

  abstract    = {Systemic administration of adenoviral vectors leads to activation of innate and antigen-specific immunity. In an attempt to diminish T and B cell-specific immune responses to E1-deleted adenoviral vectors, capsid proteins were modified with various activated monomethoxypolyethylene glycols (MPEGs). The impact of this modification was studied in a murine model of liver-directed gene transfer in which an E1-deleted adenovirus expressing the lacZ gene was given intravenously. The efficiency of vector transduction of hepatocytes in vivo was not compromised by any of the polymer chemistries. PEGylation of the virus, however, diminished the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and helper T cells of the type 1 subset (Th1 cells) against native viral antigens; neutralizing antibodies to native virus were also diminished. PEGylation prolonged transgene expression and allowed partial readministration with native virus or with a virus PEGylated with a heterologous chemical moiety. Apparently, modification of the capsid leads to a shift in antigenic epitopes because vector readministration was not possible when the immunizing vector had been modified by the same PEGylation chemistry used to modify the second vector. In light of these results, the concept of improving the performance of adenoviral vectors through modification of the capsid with PEG shows promise.},

  Abstract                 = {The light-driven photocycle of rhodopsin begins the photoreceptor cascade that underlies visual response. In a sequence of events, the retinal covalently attached to the rhodopsin protein undergoes a conformational change that communicates local changes to a global conformational change throughout the whole protein. In turn, the large-scale protein change then activates G-proteins and signal amplification throughout the cell. The nature of this change, involving a coupling between a local process and larger changes throughout the protein, may be important for many membrane proteins. In addition, functional work has shown that this coupling occurs with different efficiency in different lipid settings. To begin to understand the nature of the efficiency of this coupling in different lipid settings, we present a molecular dynamics study of rhodopsin in an explicit dioleoyl-phosphatidylcholine bilayer. Our system was simulated for 40 ns and provides insights into the very early events of the visual cascade, before the full transition and activation have occurred. In particular, we see an event near 10 ns that begins with a change in hydrogen bonding near the retinal and that leads through a series of coupled changes to a shift in helical tilt. This type of event, though rare on the molecular dynamics time-scale, could be an important clue to the types of coupling that occur between local and large-scale conformational change in many membrane proteins.

In this review, using systems for which atomistic simulations have been carried out in our groups as examples, we describe the current understanding of allostery, how the mechanisms go beyond the classical MWC/Pauling-KNF descriptions, and point out that the "new view" of allostery, emphasizing "population shifts," is, in fact, an "old view." The presentation offers not only an up-to-date description of allostery from a theoretical/computational perspective, but also helps to resolve several outstanding issues concerning allostery. 10.1110/ps.03259908},

  Abstract                 = {Thermally driven materials characterized by complex energy landscapes, such as proteins, exhibit motions on a broad range of space and time scales. Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used to extract modes of motion from protein trajectory data that correspond to coherent, functional motions. In this work, two other methods, maximum covariance analysis (MCA) and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) are formulated in a way appropriate to analyze protein trajectory data. Both methods partition the coordinates used to describe the system into two sets (two measurement domains) and inquire as to the correlations that may exist between them. MCA and CCA provide rotations of the original coordinate system that successively maximize the covariance (MCA) or correlation (CCA) between modes of each measurement domain under suitable constraint conditions. We provide a common framework based on the singular value decomposition of appropriate matrices to derive MCA and CCA. The differences between and strengths and weaknesses of MCA and CCA are discussed and illustrated. The application presented here examines the correlation between the backbone and side chain of the peptide met-enkephalin as it fluctuates between open conformations, found in solution, to closed conformations appropriate to when it is bound to its receptor. Difficulties with PCA carried out in Cartesian coordinates are found and motivate a formulation in terms of dihedral angles for the backbone atoms and selected atom distances for the side chains. These internal coordinates are a more reliable basis for all the methods explored here. MCA uncovers a correlation between combinations of several backbone dihedral angles and selected side chain atom distances of met-enkephalin. It could be used to suggest residues and dihedral angles to focus on to favor specific side chain conformers. These methods could be applied to proteins with domains that, when they rearrange upon ligand binding, may have correlated functional motions or, for multi-subunit proteins, may exhibit correlated subunit motions.},

  Abstract                 = {A new method for the production of monovalent Fab fragments of antibodies has been developed. Traditionally Fab fragments are produced by proteolytic digestion of antibodies in solution followed by isolation of Fab fragments. In the case of monoclonal antibodies against inactivated subunits of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, digestion with papain resulted in significant damage of the binding sites of the Fab fragments. Antigen was covalently attached to the polycation, poly(N-ethyl-4-vinylpyridinium bromide). Proteolysis of monoclonal antibodies in the presence of the antigen-polycation conjugate followed by (i) precipitation induced by addition of polyanion, poly(methacrylic) acid, and pH shift from 7.3 to 6.5 and (ii) elution at pH 3.0 resulted in 90\% immunologically competent Fab fragments. Moreover, the papain concentration required for proteolysis was 10 times less in the case of antibodies bound to the antigen-polycation conjugate than that of free antibodies in solution. The digestion of antibodies bound to the antigen-polyelectrolyte complex was less damaging, suggesting that binding to the antigen-polycation conjugate not only protected binding sites of monoclonal antibodies from proteolytic damage but also facilitated the proteolysis probably by exposing antibody molecules in a way convenient for proteolytic attack by papain.},

Starting with reported nonbonded parameters of alcohols, ethers, and diols, torsional parameters were fit to reproduce results from nb initio calculations on the hexopyranoses, alpha,beta-D- glucopyranose, alpha,beta-D-mannopyranose, alpha,beta-D- galactopyranose, methyl alpha,beta-D-glucopyranoside, and methyl alpha,beta-D-mannopyranoside. in all, geometry optimizations were carried out for 144 conformers at the restricted Hartree-Fock (RHF)/6-31G* level. For the conformers with a relative energy within 3 kcal/mol of the global minima, the effects of electron correlation and basis-set extension were considered by performing single-point calculations with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-311 + G** level. The torsional parameters for the OPLS-AA force field were parameterized to reproduce the energies and structures of these 44 conformers. The resultant force field reproduces the ab initio calculated energies with an average unsigned error of 0.41 kcal/mol. The alpha/beta ratios as well as the relative energies between the isomeric hexopyranoses are in good accord with the ab initio results. The predictive abilities of the force field were also tested against RHF/6-31G* results for D- allopyranose with excellent success; a surprising discovery is that the lowest energy conformer of D-allopyranose is a beta anomer.

From this comparison we find that the solvent structure around the DMPC head group (clathrate shell) is significantly different than that around the DLPE head group (typical hydrogen bonding interactions). We have modeled the probable relationship between the different solvent environments around the R-N(CH3)3+ (DMPC) and R-NH3+ (DLPE) head groups and the different interlammelar distances in these systems by performing potential of mean force (PMF) simulations on two N(CH3)4+ and NH4+ ions in water. From the PMF simulations it appears that the differences in the hydration of the DMPC and DLPE head groups is not responsible for the differences in the hydration force observed for these systems. We also find that the orientational polarization of DLPE and DMPC is similar, which suggests that solvent polarization is not responsible for the differences in the hydration repulsion behavior observed in these systems. We also examined the order parameters for DMPC and found them to be in reasonable agreement with experiment. Given the different characteristics of the DLPE and DMPC head groups, we suggest an explanation of the differences in the interlammellar spacings of bilayers composed of these like-charged lipids. From our DLPE simulations we find that the R-NH3+ head groups can interact with the nonesterified oxygens of the phosphate group in an intraleaflet or an interleaflet manner. For the latter a "cross link" between two leaflets can be formed, which causes a stabilization of the interlamellar spacings at fairly short distances. Moreover, due to the strong intraleaflet interaction we find that the DLPE interface is relatively "flat" (as opposed to DMPC-based bilayers), which results in a surface that has regions of positive and negative charge that reside in the same plane along the bilayer normal. Based on this we propose that the DLPE bilayer interface can correlate itself with another DLPE interface by alignment of the regions of positive (or negative) charge on one leaflet with the opposite charges on the opposing leaflet.},

  Abstract                 = {A 200-ps molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectory of a model dilauroylphosphatidylethanolamine (DLPE) bilayer in water at 315 K has been generated. Segmental order parameters, electron density profiles, and water pair distribution functions have been calculated. Comparison to experiment is made where possible. The dynamics of the system has been studied by analyzing the velocity autocorrelation functions (VAF) of both water and lipid atoms. Furthermore, the diffusive properties of water have been analyzed by computing the mean square displacement (MSD) and orientational correlation function (OCF) of water in two regions around the bilayer. The calculated order parameters show a behavior similar to the liquid crystalline phase of other bilayers, but the region around C1-C3 does not show the expected behavior. The electron density profile shows features that are characteristic of the liquid crystalline phase. The radial distribution functions suggest ordering of water near the charged head groups, which results in about 15 water molecules solvating each lipid molecule. We find from the VAF, MSD, and OCF calculation that the water molecules near the head groups of the lipid bilayer move more slowly than those further away. The VAF of the hydrocarbon chains have features of low-frequency motions that are probably cooperative nature in addition to the high-frequency motions associated with bond angle and torsional motions.},

The required rate constants (k(s)) at different temperatures have been determined earlier by conductometric method and the relevant activation parameters by use of the coefficients of the rate constant-temperature equation : log k(s) = AT-1 + B log T + C. Transfer energetics of IS and TS from water (w) to other solvents (s) were evaluated by coupling the activation energetics (DELTAH(not- equal)) with the previously determined enthalpies of solution (DELTAH(s)oBAR) of IS : t-BuCl and by coupling the activation free energies (AG(not-equal)) with the solvation free energies of the ion-pair (CH3)3NH+Cl- a newly proposed model of the TS : (CH3)3C(delta+)...Cl(delta-) as obtained after due correction of the previously determined solvation free energies of the salt (CH3)3NHCl in the solvents by an indirect method. Each of the transfer energetic terms of IS and TS was dissected into cavity, dipole-dipole, dispersion and the rest, hydrophobic- hydrophilic (HH) hydration terms. The latter is the composite contributions of hydrophobic hydration (H(b)H) arising from 3(CH3) groups of partially charged (CH3)3C(delta+)-group and the hydrophilic hydration (H1H) arising from partially charged Cl(delta-) atom of the TS : (CH3)3C(delta+)...Cl(delta+) of t- BuCl. DELTAX(t,HH)o(i) - and particularly TDELTAS(t,HH)o(i)- composition profiles (X = G, H and S and i = IS or TS) were then analysed in terms of four-step transfer process of Kundu et al. and the involved physicochemical properties and especially the relative structuredness of solvents, which guide the HH hydration terms. This helped to understand the observed unique minima in TDELTAS(not-equal) - and hance DELTAH(not- equal)-composition profiles in these and other aquo-organic solvents, which proved baffling since the days of the classical work of Ingold and Hughes, so to say on this key S(N1)-type reaction.},

The required individual ion contributions for the solvents, based on widely used Ph4AsPh4B (TBTB) reference electrolyte (RE) assumption, have been taken from previous studies. The chemical contributions of DELTAG(t)0(i) values of Me3NH+ and Cl- have been obtained after subtracting the respective contributions of cavity, Born and ion-dipole interactions, as computed by scaled particle theory (SPT), Born and Buckingham formulations respectively and are referred to as DELTAG(T,H1H)0(Cl-) and DELTAG(t,HbH)0(Me3NH+).

  Abstract                 = {The possibility of estimating equilibrium free-energy profiles from multiple non-equilibrium simulations using the fluctuation-dissipation theory or the relation proposed by Jarzynski has attracted much attention. Although the Jarzynski estimator has poor convergence properties for simulations far from equilibrium, corrections have been derived for cases in which the work is Gaussian distributed. Here, we examine the utility of corrections proposed by Gore and collaborators using a simple dissipative system as a test case. The system consists of a single methane-like particle in explicit water. The Jarzynski equality is used to estimate the change in free energy associated with pulling the methane particle a distance of 3.9 nm at rates ranging from ~0.1 to 100 m s(-1). It is shown that although the corrections proposed by Gore and collaborators have excellent numerical performance, the profiles still converge slowly. Even when the corrections are applied in an ideal case where the work distribution is necessarily Gaussian, performing simulations under quasi-equilibrium conditions is still most efficient. Furthermore, it is shown that even for a single methane molecule in water, pulling rates as low as 1 m s(-1) can be problematic. The implications of this finding for studies in which small molecules or even large biomolecules are pulled through inhomogeneous environments at similar pulling rates are discussed.},

Although important aspects of A peptide aggregation are understood, the initial stage of aggregation from monomer to oligomer is still not clear. One potential mediator of this early aggregation process is interactions of A with anionic cell membranes. We used unconstrained and umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulations to investigate interactions between the 42-amino acid A peptide and model bilayers of zwitterionic dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipids and anionic dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) lipids. Using these methods, we determined that A is attracted to the surface of DPPC and DOPS bilayers over the small length scales used in these simulations. We also found supporting evidence that the charge on both the bilayer surface and the peptide affects the free energy of binding of the peptide to the bilayer surface and the distribution of the peptide on the bilayer surface. Our work demonstrates that interactions between the A peptide and lipid bilayer promotes a peptide distribution on the bilayer surface that is prone to peptide-peptide interactions, which can influence the propensity of A to aggregate into higher-order structures.},

  Abstract                 = {Since experimental measurements of NMR chemical shifts provide time and ensemble averaged values, we investigated how these effects should be included when chemical shifts are computed using density functional theory (DFT). We measured the chemical shifts of the N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine-OMe (MLF) peptide in the solid state, and then used the X-ray structure to calculate the (13)C chemical shifts using the gauge including projector augmented wave (GIPAW) method, which accounts for the periodic nature of the crystal structure, obtaining an overall accuracy of 4.2 ppm. In order to understand the origin of the difference between experimental and calculated chemical shifts, we carried out first-principles molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the molecular motion of the MLF peptide on the picosecond time scale. We found that (13)C chemical shifts experience very rapid fluctuations of more than 20 ppm that are averaged out over less than 200 fs. Taking account of these fluctuations in the calculation of the chemical shifts resulted in an accuracy of 3.3 ppm. To investigate the effects of averaging over longer time scales we sampled the rotameric states populated by the MLF peptides in the solid state by performing a total of 5 micros classical molecular dynamics simulations. By averaging the chemical shifts over these rotameric states, we increased the accuracy of the chemical shift calculations to 3.0 ppm, with less than 1 ppm error in 10 out of 22 cases. These results suggests that better DFT-based predictions of chemical shifts of peptides and proteins will be achieved by developing improved computational strategies capable of taking into account the averaging process up to the millisecond time scale on which the chemical shift measurements report.},

  Abstract                 = {Phospholamban is an integral membrane protein that controls the calcium balance in cardiac muscle cells. As the function and regulation of this protein require the active involvement of low populated states in equilibrium with the native state, it is of great interest to acquire structural information about them. In this work, we calculate the conformations and populations of the ground state and the three main excited states of phospholamban by incorporating nuclear magnetic resonance residual dipolar couplings as replica-averaged structural restraints in molecular dynamics simulations. We then provide a description of the manner in which phosphorylation at Ser16 modulates the activity of the protein by increasing the sizes of the populations of its excited states. These results demonstrate that the approach that we describe provides a detailed characterization of the different states of phospholamban that determine the function and regulation of this membrane protein. We anticipate that the knowledge of conformational ensembles enable the design of new dominant negative mutants of phospholamban by modulating the relative populations of its conformational substates.},

The accurate characterization of these motions is key in order to understand the mechanisms by which macromolecular recognition events take place. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy offers a variety of powerful methods to achieve this result. We discuss a method of using residual dipolar couplings as replica-averaged restraints in molecular dynamics simulations to determine large amplitude motions of proteins, including those involved in the conformational equilibria that are established through interconversions between different states. By applying this method to ribonuclease A, we show that it enables one to characterize the ample fluctuations in interdomain orientations expected to play an important functional role.},

By increasing the concentration of KCl in the range from hypotonic to 4 M, the apparent pKa of the metarhodopsin I(MI)/MII equilibrium is shifted by approximately pH three, in favor of the MII intermediate. In addition, the apparent rate of MII formation is enhanced by an increase in ionic strength (about twofold in the presence of 2 M KCl). MIII decay is independent of the salt concentration. Attenuated-total-reflectance/FTIR data show that the high-salt conditions have no effect on the rigidity of the membrane matrix and do not induce structural changes in the intermediates themselves. Different salts were tested for their ability to shift the MI/MII equilibrium; however, no clear ion dependence was observed. We interpret these results as an indication for direct involvement of the cytosolic surface charge in the regulation of the photochemical activity of bovine rhodopsin.},

Moreover, our extensive computational analysis suggests that the most likely Rho:Gt stoichiometry is the 1:1 one. This means that the essential molecular determinants for Gt recognition and activation are contained in one Rho monomer. In this respect, the complex between one Rho molecule and one heterotrimeric Gt should be considered as the functional unit.},

The most useful products include antibiotics, anticancer agents, immunosuppressants, but products for many other applications, e.g., antivirals, anthelmintics, enzyme inhibitors, nutraceuticals, polymers, surfactants, bioherbicides, and vaccines have been commercialized. Unfortunately, due to the decrease in natural product discovery efforts, drug discovery has decreased in the past 20ÃÂ years. The reasons include excessive costs for clinical trials, too short a window before the products become generics, difficulty in discovery of antibiotics against resistant organisms, and short treatment times by patients for products such as antibiotics. Despite these difficulties, technology to discover new drugs has advanced, e.g., combinatorial chemistry of natural product scaffolds, discoveries in biodiversity, genome mining, and systems biology. Of great help would be government extension of the time before products become generic.},

Corresponding data for less stable complexes were derived from thermochemical measurements using titration calorimetry (macro and micro). Thus, Gibbs energies, enthalpies, and entropies of complexation of alkyl (methyl, ethyl, and n-butyl) p-tert-butylcalix(Li)tetraethanoates and alkali-metal cations in acetonitrile and in benzonitrile at 298.15 K are reported. The results show that as the electron- donating effect of the ligand increases in moving from the methyl to the ethyl and to a lesser extent to the tert- butylcalix(4)arene ester, making the carbonyl oxygen more electronegative, their interaction with metal cations increases. The implication of these finding on the selective recognition of alkali-metal cations by calix(4)arene esters in these solvents is discussed. It is concluded that in both solvents (i) metal ion-ligand stability (hence Gibbs energy) is enthalpically controlled and (ii) entropies of calix(4)arenate formation reflect marked differences between the solvation of the ligands relative to their metal-ion complexes.},

These titration calorimetry studies ate accompanied by C-13 and H-1 NMR measurements in acetonitrile (CD3CN). On the basis of the stability of the complexes, six new coronand electrolytes were isolated. The thermochemical behavior of these electrolytes as assessed from the standard enthalpies of solution is compared with corresponding data for common lithium salts. Interpretation of these data reveals that the new coronand electrolytes are much less solvated by these solvents than the latter. The implications of these results on the conductivity enhancement observed by the addition of 15-crown-5 and 1-aza-12-crown-4 to nonaqueous lithium solutions are demonstrated leading to the conclusion that the use of these electrolytes in lithium batteries shows promise. Enthalpies of coordination referred to reactants and products in their pure physical state for these systems are first reported. A notable feature of the data is the higher enthalpic stability observed for the coordination of 1-aza-12-crown-4 and lithium trifluoromethanesulfonate with respect to that of the same ligand and other Lithium salts. The observed enhancement of stability is within the range expected for hydrogen bond formation likely to be attributed to a specific interaction between the hydrogen atom of the aza crown ligand and the anion. Further investigations in this area are suggested with particular emphasis on fundamental research where more efforts should be geared to overcome some of the problems encountered in lithium battery technology.},

In our study, we have examined the nature of the highly charged helix-turn-helix motif (S3b and S4) to address how a highly charged peptide is stabilized within a bilayer in the presence of various transmembrane electrical potentials. Our double-bilayer simulation results show how the variation of the salt concentrations between the inner and outer bath establishes a transmembrane potential. Our results also show that important features of the peptide affected by changes in electrical potential are the center of mass depth, the swivel/kink degrees of conformation, and the hydrogen-bonding patterns. As the voltage gradient across the bilayer increased, the center of mass of the peptide shifted in a direction towards the outer bath. The peptide also has a higher percent helical content and the swivel/kink conformation is more rigid for non-polarized systems where no voltage drop occurred between salt baths. Our results also provide some suggestions for how this domain may be affected by environmental changes as part of the voltage sensor in a K-channel. 10.1529/biophysj.108.134049},

  abstract        = {Rhodopsin, the dim-light photoreceptor present in the rod cells of the retina, is both a retinal-binding protein and a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). Due to this conjunction, it benefits from an arsenal of spectroscopy techniques that can be used for its characterization, while being a model system for the important family of Class A (also referred to as "rhodopsin-like") GPCRs. For instance, rhodopsin has been a crucial player in the field of GPCR structural biology. Until 2007, it was the only GPCR for which a high-resolution crystal structure was available, so all structure-activity analyses on GPCRs, from structure-based drug discovery to studies of structural changes upon activation, were based on rhodopsin. At present, about a third of currently available GPCR structures are still from rhodopsin. In this review, I show some examples of how these structures can still be used to gain insight into general aspects of GPCR activation. First, the analysis of the third intracellular loop in rhodopsin structures allows us to gain an understanding of the structural and dynamic properties of this region, which is absent (due to protein engineering or poor electron density) in most of the currently available GPCR structures. Second, a detailed analysis of the structure of the transmembrane domains in inactive, intermediate and active rhodopsin structures allows us to detect early conformational changes in the process of ligand-induced GPCR activation. Finally, the analysis of a conserved ligand-activated transmission switch in the transmembrane bundle of GPCRs in the context of the rhodopsin activation cycle, allows us to suggest that the structures of many of the currently available agonist-bound GPCRs may correspond to intermediate active states. While the focus in GPCR structural biology is inevitably moving away from rhodopsin, in other aspects rhodopsin is still at the forefront. For instance, the first studies of the structural basis of disease mutants in GPCRs, or the most detailed analysis of cellular GPCR signal transduction networks using a systems biology approach, have been carried out in rhodopsin. Finally, due again to its unique properties among GPCRs, rhodopsin will likely play an important role in the application of X-ray free electron laser crystallography to time-resolved structural biology in membrane proteins. Rhodopsin, thus, still remains relevant as a model system to study the molecular mechanisms of GPCR activation.

  Abstract                 = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are seven transmembrane helix proteins that couple binding of extracellular ligands to conformational changes and activation of intracellular G proteins, GPCR kinases, and arrestins. Constitutively active mutants are ubiquitously found among GPCRs and increase the inherent basal activity of the receptor, which often correlates with a pathological outcome. Here, we have used the M257Y(6.40) constitutively active mutant of the photoreceptor rhodopsin in combination with the specific binding of a C-terminal fragment from the G protein alpha subunit (GÎ±CT) to trap a light activated state for crystallization. The structure of the M257Y/GÎ±CT complex contains the agonist all-trans-retinal covalently bound to the native binding pocket and resembles the G protein binding metarhodopsin-II conformation obtained by the natural activation mechanism; i.e., illumination of the prebound chromophore 11-cis-retinal. The structure further suggests a molecular basis for the constitutive activity of 6.40 substitutions and the strong effect of the introduced tyrosine based on specific interactions with Y223(5.58) in helix 5, Y306(7.53) of the NPxxY motif and R135(3.50) of the E(D)RY motif, highly conserved residues of the G protein binding site.},

We compare the negatively charged phosphatidic acid (PA), which at physiological pH and salt concentration has a negative spontaneous curvature, with the negatively charged phosphtidylglycerol (PG) and neutrally charged phosphatidylcholine (PC), both of which have zero spontaneous curvature. The PA lipids are simulated using two different sets of partial charges for the headgroup and the varied charge distribution between the two PA systems results in significantly different locations for the Na+ ions relative to the water/membrane interface. For one PA system, the Na+ ions are localized around the phosphate group. In the second PA system, the Na+ ions are located near the ester carbonyl atoms, which coincides with the preferred location site for the PG Na+ ions. We find that the Na+ ion location has a larger effect on bilayer fluidity properties than lipid headgroup size, where the Alipid and acyl chain order parameter values are more similar between the PA and PG bilayers that have Na+ ions located near the ester groups, than between the two PA bilayers. 10.1529/biophysj.107.128074},

  Abstract                 = {Outer surface protein A (OspA) is a major lipoprotein of the Borrelia burgdorferi spirochete, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Vaccination with OspA generates an immune response that can prevent bacterial transmission to a mammalian host during the attachment of an infected tick. However, the protective capacity of immune sera cannot be predicted by measuring total anti-OspA antibody. The murine monoclonal antibody LA-2 defines an important protective B-cell epitope of OspA against which protective sera have strong levels of reactivity. We have now mapped the LA-2 epitope of OspA using both NMR chemical-shift perturbation measurements in solution and X-ray crystal structure determination. LA-2 recognizes the three surface-exposed loops of the C-terminal domain of OspA that are on the tip of the elongated molecule most distant from the lipid-modified N terminus. The structure suggests that the natural variation at OspA sequence position 208 in the first loop is a major limiting factor for antibody cross-reactivity between different Lyme disease-causing Borrelia strains. The unusual Fab-dominated lattice of the crystal also permits a rare view of antigen flexibility within an antigen:antibody complex. These results provide a rationale for improvements in OspA-based vaccines and suggest possible designs for more direct tests of antibody protective levels in vaccinated individuals.},

For this study, we employed residue-based fragments distributed according to the Boltzmann factor of the optimized potential for liquid simulations all-atom (OPLS-AA) forcefield describing the individual fragments. Two solvent models were employed: a simple uniform dielectric and the generalized Born/surface area (GBSA) model. The efficiency of LBMC was compared to standard Langevin dynamics (LD) using three different statistical tools. The statistical analyses indicate that LBMC is more than 100 times faster than LD not only for the simple solvent model but also for GBSA.},

  abstract =             {Recently, membrane rafts and caveolae have received much attention for their role as signaling platforms, particularly due to their involvement in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, including HIV as well as neurological and cardiovascular conditions. Signaling mediated by the -adrenergic receptor (-AR), a member of the large family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that transduce extracellular messages via the ubiquitous second messenger, cAMP, has been a focus of raft studies since multiple components of the pathway are compartmentalized by these membrane microdomains. However, how these membrane rafts behave and regulate signaling dynamics in a cellular context is poorly understood. Here, we describe a live-cell assay based on single-cell, real-time fluorescence imaging, via an improved FRET-based cAMP biosensor, to monitor raft regulation of second messenger dynamics. Upon cholesterol depletion with methyl--cyclodextrin (MCD), 2-AR-mediated cAMP accumulation was enhanced and prolonged in HEK-293 cells, demonstrating that membrane raft integrity helps shape -AR signaling. Single-cell imaging in parallel with fractionation studies reveal that the enhancement and change of dynamics are mediated by the receptor and correlated with its redistribution. Finally, the effect of cholesterol depletion is receptor-type specific as MCD treatment did not show the same effect when the raft-excluded prostaglandin E receptor was stimulated. This study highlights the potential of a live-cell, real-time imaging assay for studying membrane rafts, including high sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution, to achieve a better understanding of the nuances of membrane microdomains in both healthy and diseased states.},

  Abstract                 = {Detailed insight into the interplay between antimicrobial peptides and biological membranes is fundamental to our understanding of the mechanism of bacterial ion channels and the action of these in biological host-defense systems. To explore this interplay, we have studied the incorporation, membrane-bound structure, and conformation of the antimicrobial peptide alamethicin in lipid bilayers using a combination of 1H liquid-state NMR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. On the basis of experimental NMR data, we evaluate simple in-plane and transmembrane incorporation models as well as pore formation for alamethicin in DMPC/DHPC (1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine/1,2-dihexanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine) bicelles. Peptide-lipid nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) and paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) data support a transmembrane configuration of the peptide in the bilayers, but they also reveal that the system cannot be described by a single simple conformational model because there is a very high degree of dynamics and heterogeneity in the three-component system. To explore the origin of this heterogeneity and dynamics, we have compared the NOE and PRE data with MD simulations of an ensemble of alamethicin peptides in a DMPC bilayer. From all-atom MD simulations, the contacts between peptide, lipid, and water protons are quantified over a time interval up to 95 ns. The MD simulations provide a statistical base that reflects our NMR data and even can explain some initially surprising NMR results concerning specific interactions between alamethicin and the lipids.},

The transfer of tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)), potassium (K+) and protonated piperidine (Hpip(+)) cations was studied by cyclic voltammetry at - 15.0 degrees C. All the half-wave potentials of these ion transfers shift in the negative direction in the frozen electrolyte system compared with the transfers from the liquid aqueous solution with the same composition at 25.0 degrees C, and some transfers from the frozen phase exhibit slight irreversibility. The degree of the negative shift increases in the order TEA(+) < Hpip(+) < K+. An interfacial redox reaction between the Fe(III)(CN)(6)(3-)/Fe(II)(CN)(6)(4-) couple in the frozen aqueous phase and the ferrocene/ferricenium cation couple in the DCE phase was studied at - 15.0 degrees C, and the half-wave potential of this reaction (the electron transfer across the interface from the aqueous to the organic DCE phase) was also more negative than that of the liquid aqueous system at 25.0 degrees C. The size of this shift is between those of TEA(+) and Hpip(+) The shifts in the half-wave potential are discussed in detail, considering a microscopic structure of water molecules near an ion and a network structure of bulk water associated through hydrogen bonds.},

  Abstract                 = {The dynamics of alpha-amylase inhibitors has been investigated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and two analytical approaches, the Gaussian network model (GNM) and anisotropic network model (ANM). MD simulations use a full atomic approach with empirical force fields, while the analytical approaches are based on a coarse-grained single-site-per-residue model with a single-parameter harmonic potential between sufficiently close (r </= 7 A) residue pairs. The major difference between the GNM and the ANM is that no directional preferences can be obtained in the GNM, all residue fluctuations being theoretically isotropic, while ANM does incorporate directional preferences. The dominant modes of motions are identified by (i) the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the MD trajectory matrices, and (ii) the similarity transformation of the Kirchhoff matrices of inter-residue contacts in the GNM or ANM. The mean-square fluctuations of individual residues and the cross-correlations between domain movements retain the same characteristics, in all approaches-although the dispersion of modes and detailed amplitudes of motion obtained in the ANM conform more closely with MD results. The major weakness of the analytical approaches appears, on the other hand, to be their inadequacy to account for the anharmonic motions or multimeric transitions driven by the slowest collective mode observed in MD. Such motions usually suffer, however, from MD sampling inefficiencies, and multiple independent runs should be tested before making conclusions about their validity and detailed mechanisms. Overall this study invites attention to (i) the robustness of the average properties (mean-square fluctuations, cross-correlations) controlled by the low frequency motions, which are invariably reproduced in all approaches, and (ii) the utility and efficiency of the ANM, the computational time cost of which is of the order of "minutes" (real time), as opposed to "days" for MD simulations.

  abstract  = {A model for random cross-linking of identical monomers diffusing in a membrane was formulated to test whether rhodopsin's cross-linking behavior was quantitatively consistent with a monomeric structure. Cross-linking was performed on rhodopsin both in intact retinas and in isolated rod outer segment (ROS) membranes using the reagent glutaraldehyde. The distribution of covalent oligomers formed was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and compared to predictions for the random model. A similar analysis was made for ROS membranes cross-linked by diisocyanatohexane and retinas cross-linked by cupric ion complexed with o-phenanthroline. Patterns of cross-linking produced by these three reagents are reasonably consistent with the monomer model. Glutaraldehyde was also used to cross-link the tetrameric protein aldolase in order to verify that cross-linking of a stable oligomer, under conditions comparable to those used for ROS, yielded the pattern predicted for a tetrameric protein having D2 symmetry. This pattern is markedly different from the one for a random-collision model. Moreover, a comparison of rates showed that aldolase cross-linking with glutaraldehyde is significantly faster than cross-linking of membrane-bound rhodopsin. It is concluded that rhodopsin is monomeric in dark-adapted photoreceptor membranes and that the observed cross-linking results from collisions between diffusing rhodopsin molecules.},

We have evaluated contamination due to Fourier bleed and ghosting due to subject motion separately. The results demonstrate that the amount of signal contamination due to motion is relatively independent of the ratio of sample width to voxel width and of the period of motion, but has a strong dependence on the number of phase-encoding steps and the amplitude of the motion.},

  Abstract                 = {Heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (G proteins) regulate cellular activity by coupling to hormone or sensory receptors. Stimulated receptors catalyse the release of GDP from G protein alpha-subunits and GTP bound to the empty alpha-subunits provides signals that control effectors such as adenylyl cyclases, phosphodiesterases, phospholipases and ion channels. Three cytoplasmic loops of the activated receptor are thought to interact with three sites on the heterotrimeric G protein to provide high-affinity interaction and catalyse G-protein activation. The carboxyl terminus of the alpha-subunit is particularly important for interaction with the receptor. Here we study the structure of part of the active interface between the photon receptor rhodopsin and the G protein transducin, or Gt, using nuclear magnetic resonance. An 11-amino-acid peptide from the C terminus of the alpha-subunit of Gt (alpha t (340-350)) binds to rhodopsin and mimics the G protein in stabilizing its active form, metarhodopsin II. The peptide alpha t (340-350) binds to both excited and unexcited rhodopsin and conformational differences between the two bound forms suggest a mechanism for activation of G proteins by agonist-stimulated receptors. Insight into receptor-catalysed GDP release will have broad application because the GTP/GDP exchange and the intrinsic GTPase activity of GTP-binding proteins constitute a widespread regulatory mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {Fully understanding the mechanisms of signaling proteins such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) will require the characterization of their conformational states and the pathways connecting those states. The recent crystal structures of the beta(2)- and beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in a nominally inactive state constituted a major advance toward this goal, but also raised new questions. Although earlier biochemical observations had suggested that these receptors possessed a set of contacts between helices 3 and 6, known as the ionic lock, which was believed to form a molecular switch for receptor activation, the crystal structures lacked these contacts. The unexpectedly broken ionic lock has raised questions about the true conformation(s) of the inactive state and the role of the ionic lock in receptor activation and signaling. To address these questions, we performed microsecond-timescale molecular dynamics simulations of the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) in multiple wild-type and mutant forms. In wild-type simulations, the ionic lock formed reproducibly, bringing the intracellular ends of helices 3 and 6 together to adopt a conformation similar to that found in inactive rhodopsin. Our results suggest that inactive beta(2)AR exists in equilibrium between conformations with the lock formed and the lock broken, whether or not the cocrystallized ligand is present. These findings, along with the formation of several secondary structural elements in the beta(2)AR loops during our simulations, may provide a more comprehensive picture of the inactive state of the beta-adrenergic receptors, reconciling the crystal structures with biochemical studies.},

  Abstract                 = {A third of marketed drugs act by binding to a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) and either triggering or preventing receptor activation. Although recent crystal structures have provided snapshots of both active and inactive functional states of GPCRs, these structures do not reveal the mechanism by which GPCRs transition between these states. Here we propose an activation mechanism for the Î²(2)-adrenergic receptor, a prototypical GPCR, based on atomic-level simulations in which an agonist-bound receptor transitions spontaneously from the active to the inactive crystallographically observed conformation. A loosely coupled allosteric network, comprising three regions that can each switch individually between multiple distinct conformations, links small perturbations at the extracellular drug-binding site to large conformational changes at the intracellular G-protein-binding site. Our simulations also exhibit an intermediate that may represent a receptor conformation to which a G protein binds during activation, and suggest that the first structural changes during receptor activation often take place on the intracellular side of the receptor, far from the drug-binding site. By capturing this fundamental signaling process in atomic detail, our results may provide a foundation for the design of drugs that control receptor signaling more precisely by stabilizing specific receptor conformations.},

  Abstract                 = {How drugs bind to their receptors--from initial association, through drug entry into the binding pocket, to adoption of the final bound conformation, or "pose"--has remained unknown, even for G-protein-coupled receptor modulators, which constitute one-third of all marketed drugs. We captured this pharmaceutically critical process in atomic detail using the first unbiased molecular dynamics simulations in which drug molecules spontaneously associate with G-protein-coupled receptors to achieve final poses matching those determined crystallographically. We found that several beta blockers and a beta agonist all traverse the same well-defined, dominant pathway as they bind to the Î²(1)- and Î²(2)-adrenergic receptors, initially making contact with a vestibule on each receptor's extracellular surface. Surprisingly, association with this vestibule, at a distance of 15 â« from the binding pocket, often presents the largest energetic barrier to binding, despite the fact that subsequent entry into the binding pocket requires the receptor to deform and the drug to squeeze through a narrow passage. The early barrier appears to reflect the substantial dehydration that takes place as the drug associates with the vestibule. Our atomic-level description of the binding process suggests opportunities for allosteric modulation and provides a structural foundation for future optimization of drug-receptor binding and unbinding rates.},

  Abstract                 = {Evidence from a variety of spectroscopic probes indicates that (phi, psi) values corresponding to the left-handed polyproline II helix (P(II)) are preferred for short alanine-based peptides in water. On the basis of results from theoretical studies, it is believed that the observed preference is dictated by favorable peptide-solvent interactions, which are realized through formation of optimal hydrogen-bonding water bridges between peptide donor and acceptor groups. In the present study, we address this issue explicitly by analyzing the hydration structure and thermodynamics of 16 low-energy conformers of the alanine dipeptide (N-acetylalanine-N'-methylamide) in liquid water. Monte Carlo simulations in the canonical ensemble were performed under ambient conditions with all-atom OPLS parameters for the alanine dipeptide and the TIP5P model for water. We find that the number of hydrogen-bonded water molecules connecting the peptide group donor and acceptor atoms has no effect on the solvation thermodynamics. Instead, the latter are determined by the work done to fully hydrate the peptide. This work is minimal for conformations that are characterized by a minimal overlap of the primary hydration shells around the peptide donor and acceptor atoms. As a result, peptide-solvent interactions favor "compact" conformations that do not include P(II)-like geometries. Our main conclusion is that the experimentally observed preference for P(II) does not arise due to favorable direct interactions between the peptide and water molecules. Instead, the latter act to unmask underlying conformational preferences that are a consequence of minimizing intrapeptide steric conflicts.},

  Abstract                 = {Poly(C)-binding proteins (PCBPs) constitute a family of nucleic acid-binding proteins that play important roles in a wide spectrum of regulatory mechanisms. The diverse functions of PCBPs are dependent on the ability of the PCBPs to recognize poly(C) sequences with high affinity and specificity. PCBPs contain three copies of KH (hnRNP K homology) domains, which are responsible for binding nucleic acids. We have determined the NMR structure of the first KH domain (KH1) from PCBP2. The PCBP2 KH1 domain adopts a structure with three alpha-helices packed against one side of a three-stranded antiparallel beta-sheet. Specific binding of PCBP2 KH1 to a number of poly(C) RNA and DNA sequences, including the C-rich strand of the human telomeric DNA repeat, the RNA template region of human telomerase, and regulatory recognition motifs in the poliovirus-1 5'-untranslated region, was established by monitoring chemical shift changes in protein (15)N-HSQC spectra. The nucleic acid binding groove was further mapped by chemical shift perturbation upon binding to a six-nucleotide human telomeric DNA. The binding groove is an alpha/beta platform formed by the juxtaposition of two alpha-helices, one beta-strand, and two flanking loops. Whereas there is a groove in common with all of the DNA and RNA binders with a hydrophobic floor accommodating a three-residue stretch of C residues, nuances in recognizing flanking residues are provided by hydrogen bonding partners in the KH domain. Specific interactions of PCBP2 KH1 with telomeric DNA and telomerase RNA suggest that PCBPs may participate in mechanisms involved in the regulation of telomere/telomerase functions.},

The measurements reveal the presence of forces in addition to those described by classical DLVO theory. At pH 7.2 in 0.01M NaBr solution, we find an additional short-range oscillatory force with periodicity approximately equal to twice the diameter of a water molecule. At pH 3 we find an additional strong, short- range, monotonic, repulsive force and a long-range attractive force over a range of NaBr concentrations from 0.001M to 0.1M. Both monotonic forces are approximately exponential, with decay lengths of 0.55 and 12 nm, respectively. The short-range force is analogous to hydration forces previously measured on negatively charged surfaces. This force would provide plasticity to alumina slurries and is suggested to be the force responsible for the anomalous viscosity and consolidation behavior of alumina slurries at high salt concentrations.},

  annotation = {Monte Carlo (MC) statistical mechanics simulations have been carried out for more than 200 organic solutes, including 125 drugs and related heterocycles, in aqueous solution. The calculations were highly automated and used the OPLS-AA force field augmented with CM1P partial charges. Configurationally averaged results were obtained for a variety of physically significant quantities including the solute-water Coulomb and Lennard-Jones interaction energies, solvent-accessible surface area (SASA), and numbers of donor and acceptor hydrogen bonds. Correlations were then obtained between these descriptors and gas to liquid free energies of solvation in hexadecane, octanol, and water and octanol/water partition coefficients. Linear regressions with three or four descriptors yielded fits with correlation coefficients, r(2), of 0.9 in all cases. The regression equation for log P(octanol/water) only needs four descriptors to provide an rms error of 0.55 for 200 diverse compounds, which is competitive with the best fragment methods. For water, the expanded data set of 85 solutes and improved statistical analyses bring into question the significance of the Lennard-Jones and surface area terms that have been featured in prior linear-response treatments. The results are sensitive to the choice of partial charges for the solute atoms; poor representation of some functional groups can lead to the need for specific corrections in the regression equations. This is expected to also be true for force-field- based scoring functions for protein-ligand binding. In all cases, the present descriptors that emerge as most significant sensibly reveal the key physical factors that control solvation, especially solute size in organic solvents and electrostatic interactions in water. Furthermore, additional MC simulations for solutes in both water and ethanol clearly demonstrate that the key differential between water and alcohols is the greater hydrogren-bond-donating ability of water, which explains the significance of a solute's hydrogen- bond-accepting ability for log P(octanol/water).},

L., Altenbach, C., Yang, K., Hubbell, W. L., and Khorana, H. G. (1996) Science 274, 768-770). We investigated this hypothesis using a series of eight rhodopsin mutants containing single reactive cysteine residues in the region (helix F) where movement was previously detected. The cysteine mutants were studied in two ways, by measuring their reactivity to a cysteine-specific reagent (PyMPO-maleimide), and by labeling the cysteines with a fluorescent label (monobromobimane) followed by fluorescence spectroscopic analysis. The chemical reactivity data showed sequence-specific variations in reactivity for the mutants in the dark state, resulting in a pattern suggestive of an alpha helix. Interestingly, only upon photoactivation to the MII form did residues found on the inner "face" of this helix react with the PyMPO-maleimide. The ability of the dark state mutants to react with the fluorescent label monobromobimane followed a similar pattern. Furthermore, fluorescence measurements indicate that a bimane label on the inner face of the helix (at V250C) detects changes in the polarity of its environment and accessibility to a fluorescence quenching agent upon MII formation. Viewed together, the data provide further direct evidence that rhodopsin activation involves a conformational change at helix F.},

The simulations were performed using different ensembles and electrostatic conditions: a microcanonical ensemble or constant pressure-temperature ensemble, with or without truncated electrostatic interactions. Calculated properties of the membrane patches from the three different protocols were compared to available data from experiments. These data include the resulting overall geometrical dimensions, the order characteristics of the lipid hydrocarbon chains, as well as various measures of the conformations of the polar head groups. The comparisons indicate that the simulation carried out within the microcanonical ensemble with truncated electrostatic interactions yielded results closest to the experimental data, provided that the initial equilibration phase preceding the production run was sufficiently long. The effects of embedding a non-ideal helical protein domain in the membrane patch were studied with the same MD protocols. This simulation was carried out for 2.5 ns. The protein domain corresponds to the seventh transmembrane segment (TMS7) of the human serotonin 5HT(2A) receptor. The peptide is composed of two alpha-helical segments linked by a hinge domain around a perturbing Asn-Pro motif that produces at the end of the simulation a kink angle of nearly 80 degrees between the two helices. Several aspects of the TMS7 structure, such as the bending angle, backbone Phi, and Psi torsion angles, the intramolecular hydrogen bonds, and the overall conformation, were found to be very similar to those determined by NMR for the corresponding transmembrane segment of the tachykinin NK-I receptor. In general, the simulations were found to yield structural and dynamic characteristics that are in good agreement with experiment. These findings support the application of simulation methods to the study of the complex biomolecular systems at the membrane interface Of cells. (C) 1999 Academic Press.},

  abstract             = {The photoreceptor rhodopsin is a G-protein coupled receptor that has recently been proposed to exist as a dimer or higher order oligomer, in contrast to the previously described monomer, in retinal rod outer segment disk membranes. Rhodopsin exhibits considerably greater thermal stability than opsin (the bleached form of the receptor), which is reflected in an [\~{}]15{degrees}C difference in the thermal denaturation temperatures (Tm) of rhodopsin and opsin as measured by differential scanning calorimetry. Here we use differential scanning calorimetry to investigate the effect of partial bleaching of disk membranes on the Tm of rhodopsin and of opsin in native disk membranes, as well as in cross-linked disk membranes in which rhodopsin dimers are known to be present. The Tms of rhodopsin and opsin are expected to be perturbed if mixed oligomers are present. The Tm remained constant for rhodopsin and opsin in native disks regardless of the level of bleaching. In contrast, the Tm of cross-linked rhodopsin in disk membranes was dependent on the extent of bleaching. The energy of activation for denaturation of rhodopsin and cross-linked rhodopsin was calculated. Cross-linking rhodopsin significantly decreased the energy of activation. We conclude that in native disk membranes, rhodopsin behaves predominantly as a monomer. 10.1529/biophysj.108.128868},

  Abstract                 = {Rhodopsin, the pigment protein responsible for dim-light vision, is a G protein-coupled receptor that converts light absorption into the activation of a G protein, transducin, to initiate the visual response. We have crystallised detergent-solubilised bovine rhodopsin in the native form and after chemical modifications as needles 10-40 microm in cross-section. The crystals belong to the trigonal space group P3(1), with two molecules of rhodopsin per asymmetric unit, related by a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis parallel with the crystallographic screw axis along c (needle axis). The unit cell dimensions are a=103.8 A, c=76.6 A for native rhodopsin, but vary over a wide range after heavy atom derivatisation, with a between 101.5 A and 113.9 A, and c between 76.6 A and 79.2 A. Rhodopsin molecules are packed with the bundle of transmembrane helices tilted from the c-axis by about 100 degrees . The two molecules in the asymmetric unit form contacts along the entire length of their transmembrane helices 5 in an antiparallel orientation, and they are stacked along the needle axis according to the 3-fold screw symmetry. Hence hydrophobic contacts are prominent at protein interfaces both along and normal to the needle axis. The best crystals of native rhodopsin in this crystal form diffracted X-rays from a microfocused synchrotron source to 2.55 A maximum resolution. We describe steps taken to extend the diffraction limit from about 10 A to 2.6 A.},

  Abstract                 = {To gain insight into the interactions between fengycin and skin membrane lipids, mixed fengycin/ceramide monolayers were investigated using atomic force microscopy (AFM) (monolayers supported on mica) and surface pressure-area isotherms (monolayers at the air-water interface). AFM topographic images revealed phase separation in mixed monolayers prepared at 20 degrees C/pH 2 and composed of 0.25 and 0.5 fengycin molar ratios, in the form of two-dimensional (2-D) hexagonal crystalline domains of ceramide surrounded by a fengycin-enriched fluid phase. Surface pressure-area isotherms as well as friction and adhesion AFM images confirmed that the two phases had different molecular orientations: while ceramide formed a highly ordered phase with crystalline chain packing, fengycin exhibited a disordered fluid phase with the peptide ring lying horizontally on the substrate. Increasing the temperature and pH to values corresponding to the skin parameters, i.e., 37 degrees C/pH 5, was found to dramatically affect the film organization. At low fengycin molar ratio (0.25), the hexagonal ceramide domains transformed into round domains, while at higher ratio (0.5) these were shown to melt into a continuous fengycin/ceramide fluid phase. These observations were directly supported by the thermodynamic analysis (deviation from the additivity rule, excess of free energy) of the monolayer properties at the air-water interface. Accordingly, this study demonstrates that both the environmental conditions (temperature, pH) and fengycin concentration influence the molecular organization of mixed fengycin/ceramide monolayers. We believe that the ability to modulate the formation of 2-D domains in the skin membrane may be an important biological function of fengycin, which should be increasingly investigated in future pharmacological research.},

AFM imaging o f spread SC lipids/fengycin monolayers showed that fengycin preferentially partitions into cholesterol-rich phases surrounding 2D domains mainly constituted of ceramide and fatty acid molecules. Penetration experiments of fengycin from the subphase into SC-mimicking monolayers clearly indicated that the lipopeptide insertion at the lipid interface is enhanced in the presence of cholesterol. AFM analysis of mixed SC lipids/fengycin monolayers obtained after lipopeptide penetration revealed that cholesterol strongly interacts with fengycin and undergoes specific molecular interactions with more disordered, loosely packed ceramide molecules. These results highlight the capacity of fengycin to interact with the lipid constituents of the extracellular matrix of SC and, in particular, with cholesterol.},

  Abstract                 = {Incorporation of beta-sheet proteins into membrane is studied theoretically for the first time, and the results are validated by the direct experimental data. Using Monte Carlo simulations with implicit membrane, we explore spatial structure, energetics, polarity, and mode of insertion of two cardiotoxins with different membrane-destabilizing activity. Both proteins, classified as P- and S-type cardiotoxins, are found to retain the overall "three-finger" fold interacting with membrane core and lipid/water interface by the tips of the "fingers" (loops). The insertion critically depends upon the structure, hydrophobicity, and electrostatics of certain regions. The simulations reveal apparently distinct binding modes for S- and P-type cardiotoxins via the first loop or through all three loops, respectively. This rationalizes an earlier empirical classification of cardiotoxins into S- and P-type, and provides a basis for the analysis of experimental data on their membrane affinities. Accomplished with our previous simulations of membrane alpha-helices, the computational method may be used to study partitioning of proteins with diverse folds into lipid bilayers.},

  abstract =    {Absorption of light by the visual pigment rhodopsin triggers a rapid cis-trans photoisomerization of its retinal chromophore and a series of conformational changes in both the retinal and protein. The largest structural change is an outward tilt of transmembrane helix H6 that increases the separation of the intracellular ends of H6 and H3 and opens up the G-protein binding site. In the dark state of rhodopsin, Glu247 at the intracellular end of H6 forms a salt bridge with Arg135 on H3 to tether H6 in an inactive conformation. The Arg135-Glu247 interaction is broken in the active state of the receptor, and Arg135 is then stabilized by interactions with Tyr223, Met257, and Tyr306 on helices H5, H6, and H7, respectively. To address the mechanism of H6 motion, solid-state NMR measurements are undertaken of Metarhodopsin I (Meta I), the intermediate preceding the active Metarhodopsin II (Meta II) state of the receptor. (13)C NMR dipolar recoupling measurements reveal an interhelical contact of (13)CÎ¶-Arg135 with (13)CÎµ-Met257 in Meta I but not with (13)CÎ¶-Tyr223 or (13)CÎ¶-Tyr306. These observations suggest that helix H6 has rotated in the formation of Meta I but that structural changes involving helices H5 and H7 have not yet occurred. Together, our results provide insights into the sequence of events leading up to the outward motion of H6, a hallmark of G protein-coupled receptor activation.},

Nevertheless, these receptors have widely divergent sequences with no significant homology. We present a detailed structure-function comparison of the very divergent Class A and D receptors to address whether there is a common activation mechanism across the GPCR superfamily. The Class A and D receptors are represented by the vertebrate visual pigment rhodopsin and the yeast alpha-factor pheromone receptor Ste2, respectively. Conserved amino acids within each specific receptor class and amino acids where mutation alters receptor function were located in the structures of rhodopsin and Ste2 to assess whether there are functionally equivalent positions or regions within these receptors. We find several general similarities that are quite striking. First, strongly polar amino acids mediate helix interactions. Their mutation generally leads to loss of function or constitutive activity. Second, small and weakly polar amino acids facilitate tight helix packing. Third, proline is essential at similar positions in transmembrane helices 6 and 7 of both receptors. Mapping the specific location of the conserved amino acids and sites of constitutively active mutations identified conserved microdomains on transmembrane helices H3, H6, and H7, suggesting that there are underlying similarities in the mechanism of the widely divergent Class A and Class D receptors.},

  Abstract                 = {Insufficient supply to the developing brain of docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n3, DHA), or its omega-3 fatty acid precursors, results in replacement of DHA with docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n6, DPA), an omega-6 fatty acid that is lacking a double bond near the chain's methyl end. We investigated membranes of 1-stearoyl(d(35))-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-stearoyl(d(35))-2-docosapentaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine by solid-state NMR, X-ray diffraction, and molecular dynamics simulations to determine if the loss of this double bond alters membrane physical properties. The low order parameters of polyunsaturated chains and the NMR relaxation data indicate that both DHA and DPA undergo rapid conformational transitions with correlation times of the order of nanoseconds at carbon atom C(2) and of picoseconds near the terminal methyl group. However, there are important differences between DHA- and DPA-containing lipids: the DHA chain with one additional double bond is more flexible at the methyl end and isomerizes with shorter correlation times. Furthermore, the stearic acid paired with the DHA in mixed-chain lipids has lower order, in particular in the middle of the chain near carbons C(10)(-)(12), indicating differences in the packing of hydrocarbon chains. Such differences are also reflected in the electron density profiles of the bilayers and in the simulation results. The DHA chain has a higher density near the lipid-water interface, whereas the density of the stearic acid chain is higher in the bilayer center. The loss of a single double bond from DHA to DPA results in a more even distribution of chain densities along the bilayer normal. We propose that the function of integral membrane proteins such as rhodopsin is sensitive to such a redistribution.},

Using the cyclic peptide coupled with fluorescence-labeled streptavidin, we have analyzed the cell surface localization of PE in dividing Chinese hamster ovary cells. We found that PE was exposed on the cell surface specifically at the cleavage furrow during the late telophase of cytokinesis. PE was exposed on the cell surface only during the late telophase and no alteration in the distribution of the plasma membrane-bound cyclic peptide was observed during the cytokinesis, suggesting that the surface exposure of PE reflects the enhanced scrambling of PE at the cleavage furrow. Furthermore, cell surface immobilization of PE induced by adding the cyclic peptide coupled with streptavidin to prometaphase cells effectively blocked the cytokinesis at late telophase. The peptide-streptavidin complex treatment had no effect on furrowing, rearrangement of microtubules, and nuclear reconstitution, but specifically inhibited both actin filament disassembly at the cleavage furrow and subsequent membrane fusion. These results suggest that the redistribution of the plasma membrane phospholipids is a crucial step for cytokinesis and the cell surface PE may play a pivotal role in mediating a coordinate movement between the contractile ring and plasma membrane to achieve successful cell division.},

In this study we have analyzed the cell surface exposure of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in apoptotic CTLL-2 cells, a cytotoxic T cell line, using a tetracyclic polypeptide of 19 amino acids (Ro09-0198) which specifically recognizes the structure of PE and forms a tight equimolar complex with the phospholipid. Fluorescence microscopic analysis showed that the peptide, conjugated with fluorescence-labeled streptavidin (FL-SA-Ro), bound effectively to the cell surface of cells undergoing apoptosis in response to withdrawal of interleukin-2 from the culture media, but not to nonapoptotic cells. The binding of FL-SA-Ro to apoptotic cells was not uniform and the intense staining was observed on surface blebs of apoptotic cells. The FL-SA-Ro binding was inhibited specifically by liposomes containing PE, suggesting that PE is mainly exposed on the surface blebs of apoptotic cells. The specific binding of FL-SA-Ro to the apoptotic cells was also confirmed using a flourescence-activated cell sorter and the time-dependent cell surface exposure of PE correlated well with the exposure of PS, as detected by the binding of annexin V. This study provides the first direct evidence that PE as well as PS is exposed on the cell surface during the early stages of apoptosis, resulting in the total loss of asymmetric distribution of aminophospholipids in the plasma membrane bilayer.},

  Abstract                 = {Phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is a major membrane phospholipid that is mainly localized in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. We previously demonstrated that PE was exposed on the cell surface of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. Immobilization of cell surface PE by a PE-binding peptide inhibited disassembly of the contractile ring components, including myosin II and radixin, resulting in formation of a long cytoplasmic bridge between the daughter cells. This blockade of contractile ring disassembly was reversed by removal of the surface-bound peptide, suggesting that the PE exposure plays a crucial role in cytokinesis. To further examine the role of PE in cytokinesis, we established a mutant cell line with a specific decrease in the cellular PE level. On the culture condition in which the cell surface PE level was significantly reduced, the mutant ceased cell growth in cytokinesis, and the contractile ring remained in the cleavage furrow. Addition of PE or ethanolamine, a precursor of PE synthesis, restored the cell surface PE on the cleavage furrow and normal cytokinesis. These findings provide the first evidence that PE is required for completion of cytokinesis in mammalian cells, and suggest that redistribution of PE on the cleavage furrow may contribute to regulation of contractile ring disassembly.},

The constriction is powered by a contractile ring of actin filaments, and scission involves rearrangement of the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. We have shown that the lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), which normally resides in the internal leaflet of the bilayer, is exposed on the external leaflet of the cleavage furrow as a result of enhanced transbilayer movement of the phospholipids during cytokinesis. To investigate the role of PE in cytokinesis, we employed two different approaches: manipulation of cell surface PE by a PE-binding peptide and establishment of a mutant cell line specifically defective in PE biosynthesis. Both approaches provide evidence that surface exposure of PE is essential for disassembly of the contractile ring at the final stage of cytokinesis. Based on these findings, we proposed that the transbilayer redistribution of PE plays a critical role in mediating coordinated movements between the contractile ring and the plasma membrane that are required for the proper progression of cytokinesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) was employed to study the molecular dynamics of three structurally related sterols, namely, cholesterol, lanosterol, and ergosterol. Oriented bilayers of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) were investigated at 40 mol % sterol content and at three temperatures (20, 36, and 50 degrees C) for two energy resolutions. Data analysis was concentrated on a direct comparison of the out-of-plane and the in-plane high-frequency motions of the three sterols in terms of their rates and amplitudes. The (spatially restricted) diffusive motion of the three sterols in the two directions was characterized by diffusion constants in the range of (5-30) x 10(-12) x m(2) x s(-1), with a significantly faster rate of diffusion along the membrane normal, resulting in a diffusional anisotropy, D(a). At low temperature (20 degrees C), cholesterol showed the highest value (D(a) = 4.5), while lanosterol gave the lowest one (D(a) = 2.0). At high temperature (50 degrees C), ergosterol diffusion had the highest diffusion anisotropy (D(a) = 2.0) compared to lanosterol (D(a) = 1.8) and cholesterol (D(a) = 1.6). Most interestingly, cholesterol showed at all three temperatures an amplitude of its out-of-plane-motion of 1.0-1.1 nm, more than a factor of 3 higher than measured for the other two sterols. This finding suggests that the short alkyl chain of the cholesterol molecule may cross at high frequency the bilayer midplane, while the other two sterols remain confined within the geometrical limits of each monolayer leaflet. The results provide an example of how slight structural alterations of sterols can affect their molecular dynamics in bilayers, which in turn may be relevant to the membrane micromechanical properties.},

In this article, we provide the coarse-graining method, referred to as "dynamic model condensation," which enables the further coarse-graining of protein structures consisting of small number of residues. It is shown that the coarser-grained structures reconstructed by dynamic model condensation exhibit the dynamic characteristics, such as low-frequency normal modes, qualitatively comparable to original structures. This sheds light on that dynamic model condensation and may enable one to study the large protein dynamics for gaining insight into biological functions of proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {NAP-22, a major protein of neuronal rafts is known to preferentially bind to membranes containing cholesterol. In this work we establish the requirements for membrane binding of NAP-22. We find that other sterols can replace cholesterol to promote binding. In addition, bilayers containing phosphatidylethanolamine bind NAP-22 in the absence of cholesterol. Thus, there is not a specific interaction of NAP-22 with cholesterol that determines its binding to membranes. Addition of a mol fraction of phosphatidylserine of 0.05 to membranes of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol enhances the membrane binding of NAP-22. The dependence of binding on the mol fraction of phosphatidylserine indicates that NAP-22 binds to membranes with its amino-terminal segment closer to the membrane than the remainder of the protein. We have also determined which segments of NAP-22 are required for membrane binding. A non-myristoylated form binds only weakly to membranes. Truncating the protein from 226 amino acids to the myristoylated aminoterminal 60 amino acids does not prevent binding to membranes in a cholesterol-dependent manner, but this binding is of weaker affinity. However, myristoylation is not sufficient to promote binding to cholesterol-rich domains. An N-terminal 19-amino-acid, myristoylated peptide binds to membranes but without requiring specific lipids. Thus, the remainder of the protein contributes to the lipid specificity of the membrane binding of NAP-22.},

  Abstract                 = {Five AHCAPs exhibiting a broad-spectrum of antimicrobial activity, were examined with regard to their action in lipid mixtures with two anionic lipids, PG and CL. We find that all of the peptides studied were capable of promoting the formation of crystalline phases of DMPG in mixtures of DMPG and CL, without prior incubation at low temperatures. This property is indicative of the ability of these peptides to cluster CL away from DMPG. In contrast, the well studied antimicrobial cationic peptide magainin 2 does not cluster anionic lipids. We ascribe the lower anionic lipid clustering ability of magainin to its low density of positive charges compared with the five other AHCAPs used in this work. The peptide MSI-1254 was particularly potent in segregating these two anionic lipids. Consequently, clusters enriched in DMPG appear in a lipid mixture with CL. These can rapidly form higher temperature crystalline phases because of the increased permeability of the bilayer caused by the AHCAPs. The polyaminoacids, poly-L-Lysine and poly-l-arginine are also very effective in causing this segregation. Thus, the clustering of anionic lipids by AHCAPs is not confined only to mixtures of anionic with zwitterionic lipids, but it extends to mixtures containing different anionic headgroups. The resulting effects, however, have different consequences to the biological activity. This finding broadens the scope for which an AHCAP agent will cluster lipids in a membrane.},

  Abstract                 = {Antimicrobial agents are toxic to bacteria by a variety of mechanisms. One mechanism that is very dependent on the lipid composition of the bacterial membrane is the clustering of anionic lipid by cationic antimicrobial agents. Certain species of oligo-acyl-lysine (OAK) antimicrobial agents are particularly effective in clustering anionic lipids in mixtures mimicking the composition of bacterial membranes. The clustering of anionic lipids by certain cationic antimicrobial agents contributes to the anti-bacterial action of these agents. Bacterial membrane lipids are a determining factor, resulting in some species of bacteria being more susceptible than others. In addition, lipids can be used to increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents when administered in vivo. Therefore, we review some of the structures in which lipid mixtures can assemble, to more effectively be utilized as antimicrobial delivery systems. We describe in more detail the complexes formed between mixtures of lipids mimicking bacterial membranes and an OAK and their usefulness in synergizing with antibiotics to overcome bacterial multidrug resistance.},

A brief review of some of the diverse methodologies used to identify the presence of domains in membranes is given. Some of these domains are enriched in cholesterol. The segregation of lipids into cholesterol-rich domains can occur in both pure lipid systems as well as membranes containing peptides and proteins. Peptides and proteins can promote the formation of cholesterol-rich domains not only by preferentially interacting with cholesterol and being sequestered into these regions of the membrane, but also indirectly as a consequence of being excluded from cholesterol-rich domains. The redistribution of components is dictated by the thermodynamics of the system. The formation of domains in a biological membrane is a consequence of all of the intermolecular interactions including those among lipid molecules as well as between lipids and proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {NAP-22, a myristoylated, anionic protein, is a major protein component of the detergent-insoluble fraction of neurons. After extraction from the membrane, it is readily soluble in water. NAP-22 will partition only into membranes with specific lipid compositions. The lipid specificity is not expected for a monomeric myristoylated protein. We have studied the self-association of NAP-22 in solution. Sedimentation velocity experiments indicated that the protein is largely associated. The low concentration limiting s value is approximately 1.3 S, indicating a highly asymmetric monomer. In contrast, a nonmyristoylated form of the protein shows no evidence of oligomerization by velocity sedimentation and has an s value corresponding to the smallest component of NAP-22, but without the presence of higher oligomers. Sedimentation equilibrium runs indicate that there is a rapidly reversible equilibrium between monomeric and oligomeric forms of the protein followed by a slower, more irreversible association into larger aggregates. In situ atomic force microscopy of the protein deposited on mica from freshly prepared dilute solution revealed dimers on the mica surface. The values of the association constants obtained from the sedimentation equilibrium data suggest that the weight concentration of the monomer exceeds that of the dimer below a total protein concentration of 0.04 mg/ml. Since the concentration of NAP-22 in the neurons of the developing brain is approximately 0.6 mg/ml, if the protein were in solution, it would be in oligomeric form and bind specifically to cholesterol-rich domains. We demonstrate, using fluorescence resonance energy transfer, that at low concentrations, NAP-22 labeled with Texas Red binds equally well to liposomes of phosphatidylcholine either with or without the addition of 40 mol\% cholesterol. Thus, oligomerization of NAP-22 contributes to its lipid selectivity during membrane binding.},

Our results indicate that these models of the fusogenic domains of viral fusion proteins promote conversion of model membrane bilayers to nonbilayer phases. This is opposite to the effects of peptides and proteins that inhibit viral fusion. A peptide model for the fusion segment of the HA protein of influenza increased membrane leakage as well as promoted the formation of nonbilayer phases upon acidification from pH 7-5.

  Abstract                 = {There has been increasing interest in recent years in describing the lateral organization of membranes and the formation of membrane domains. Much of the focus in this area has been on the formation of cholesterol-rich domains in mammalian membranes. However, it is likely that there are domains in all biological membranes. One of the challenges has been to define the chemical composition, lifetime and size of these domains. There is evidence that bacteria have domains that are enriched in cardiolipin. In addition, the formation of lipid domains can be induced in bacteria by clustering negatively charged lipids with polycationic substances. Many antimicrobial compounds have multiple positive charges. Such polycationic compounds can sequester anionic lipids to induce lipid phase separation. The molecular interactions among lipids and their lateral packing density will be different in a domain from its environment. This will lead to phase boundary defects that will lower the permeability barrier between the cell and its surroundings. The formation of these clusters of anionic lipids may also alter the stability or composition of existing membrane domains that may affect bacterial function. Interestingly many antimicrobial agents are polycationic and therefore likely have some effect in promoting lipid phase segregation between anionic and zwitterionic lipids. However, this mechanism is expected to be most important for substances with sequential positive charges contained within a flexible molecule that can adapt to the arrangement of charged groups on the surface of the bacterial cell. When this mechanism is dominant it can allow the prediction of the bacterial species that will be most affected by the agent as a consequence of the nature of the lipid composition of the bacterial membrane.},

  Abstract                 = {Three Arg-rich nonapeptides, containing the same amino acid composition but different sequences, PFWRIRIRR-amide (PR-9), RRPFWIIRR-amide (RR-9) and PRFRWRIRI-amide (PI-9), are able to induce segregation of anionic lipids from zwitterionic lipids, as shown by changes in the phase transition properties of lipid mixtures detected by differential scanning calorimetry and freeze fracture electron microscopy. The relative Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of these three peptides against several strains of Gram positive bacteria correlated well with the extent to which the lipid composition of the bacterial membrane facilitated peptide-induced clustering of anionic lipids. The lower activity of these three peptides against Gram negative bacteria could be explained by the retention of these peptides in the LPS layer. The membrane morphologies produced by PR-9 as well as by a cathelicidin fragment, KR-12 that had previously been shown to induce anionic lipid clustering, was directly visualized using freeze fracture electron microscopy. This work shows the insensitivity of phase segregation to the specific arrangement of the cationic charges in the peptide sequence as well as to their tendency to form different secondary structures. It also establishes the role of anionic lipid clustering in the presence of zwitterionic lipids in determining antimicrobial selectivity.},

  Abstract                 = {Cholesterol forms crystals when the mol fraction of sterol in a membrane bilayer exceeds a certain value. The solubility limit of cholesterol is very dependent on the nature of the phospholipid with which it is mixed. NMR methods have proven useful in quantifying the amount of cholesterol monohydrate crystals present in mixtures with phospholipids. A protein, NAP-22, present in high abundance in the synaptic cell membrane and synaptic vesicle, promotes the formation of cholesterol crystallites in lipid mixtures in which cholesterol would be completely dissolved in the membrane in the absence of protein. This finding, along with effects of the protein on the phase transitions of mixtures of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and cholesterol indicate that NAP-22 facilitates the formation of cholesterol-rich domains. This protein will bind only to membranes of PC that contain either cholesterol or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). The process requires the presence of a myristoyl group on the N-terminus of NAP-22. The phenomenon also does not occur with a 19 amino acid myristoylated peptide corresponding to the amino terminal segment of NAP-22. The basis of the selectivity of NAP-22 for interacting with membranes of specific composition is suggested to be due to the accessibility of the myristoyl group.},

  Abstract                 = {A major protein of neuronal rafts, NAP-22, binds specifically to cholesterol. We demonstrate by circular dichroism that NAP-22 contains a significant amount of beta-structure that is not sensitive to binding of the protein to membranes, suggesting that a major portion of the protein does not insert deeply into the membrane. The free energy of binding of NAP-22 to liposomes of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine with 40\% cholesterol is -7.3 +/- 0.5 kcal/mol. NAP-22 mixed with dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and 40\% cholesterol partitions into the detergent insoluble fraction in the presence of 1\% Triton X-100. NAP-22 also causes this insoluble fraction to become enriched in cholesterol relative to phospholipid, again demonstrating the ability of this protein to segregate cholesterol and phospholipids into domains. Differential scanning calorimetry results demonstrate that NAP-22 promotes domain formation in liposomes composed of cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine. This is shown by NAP-22-promoted changes in the shape and enthalpy of the phase transition of phosphatidylcholine as well as by the appearance of cholesterol crystallite transitions in membranes composed of phosphatidylcholine with either saturated or unsaturated acyl chains. In situ atomic force microscopy revealed a marked change in the surface morphology of a supported bilayer of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine with 0.4 mole fraction of cholesterol upon addition of NAP-22. Prior to the addition of the protein, the bilayer appears to be a molecularly smooth structure with uniform thickness. Addition of NAP-22 resulted in the rapid formation of localized raised bilayer domains. Remarkably, there was no gross disruption or erosion of the bilayer but rather simply an apparent rearrangement of the lipid bilayer structure due to the interaction of NAP-22 with the lipid. Our results demonstrate that NAP-22 can induce the formation of cholesterol-rich domains in membranes. This is likely to be relevant in neuronal membrane domains that are rich in NAP-22.},

These agents have varying degrees of toxicity against different bacterial species. We demonstrate, using members of a novel class of antimicrobial agents, the oligomers of acyllysine, that one cause for the difference in species selectivity is the ability to induce the clustering of anionic lipids, resulting in their segregation into domains. This phenomenon occurs only in bacterial membranes composed of both anionic and zwitterionic lipids and not with bacteria whose membrane lipids are largely anionic. As a consequence it can be predicted which bacterial species will be most affected by antimicrobial agents that function principally by this mechanism. This finding allows for the design of new antibiotics with selective toxicity against different groups of bacteria.},

  Abstract                 = {The peptide N-acetyl-LWYIK-amide causes the reorganization of bilayers of phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol to produce domains enriched in cholesterol. At a cholesterol mol fraction of 0.5, addition of N-acetyl-LWYIK-amide results in the formation of cholesterol crystallites. Addition of this peptide to mixtures of 1-stearoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine with lower mol fractions of cholesterol results in an increase in the enthalpy of the chain melting transition of the phospholipid, indicating the depletion of cholesterol from a domain in the membrane. The peptide binds to membranes both with and without cholesterol. However, (1)H magic-angle spinning (MAS) nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) indicates that in the presence of cholesterol the peptide has greater penetration into the bilayer. (13)C MAS NMR indicates that the peptide has stronger interactions with the A ring of cholesterol than it does with the interior of the bilayer. These results are in contrast with those of another peptide, N-acetyl-KYWFYR-amide, which does not promote the formation of cholesterol crystallites and does not show preferential interaction with cholesterol by NMR. Therefore, cholesterol can promote the insertion of N-acetyl-LWYIK-amide into a membrane and this peptide will sequester cholesterol into domains. These properties help to explain the observation that this sequence is found to be important in causing the fusion protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to sequester into raft domains in biological membranes.},

Mixtures of phosphatidylserine with phosphatidylethanolamine and cholesterol (molar ratio 1:1:2) show polymorphic behavior at higher temperatures and in the presence of Ca2+. Mixtures with L-PS undergo conversion to nonlamellar phases at lower temperatures than do similar mixtures with D-PS. The aggregation of vesicles upon addition of histones is greater for L-PS than for D-PS. With fluorescence digital imaging microscopy we could show differences in the extent of formation of histone-induced domains enriched in PS or in diacylglycerol. The most enriched domains were induced with histone in membranes containing L-PS. The MARCKS peptide showed no differences in domain formation between L-PS and D-PS. The maximal activity of protein kinase C was greater in the presence of L-PS when histone, which could form more enriched domains, was the substrate. However, with a MARCKS peptide substrate, which formed domains of equal enrichment with L-PS and D-PS, the maximal activity of protein kinase C was the same with D-PS and with L-PS. These observations demonstrate that L-PS and D-PS have different physical properties. These differences likely contribute to the greater ability of L-PS to activate protein kinase C.},

The exchange between these two lipid domains is slow on the millisecond time scale. The interactions between this peptide and phospholipid are diminished above the melting temperature of the complex. The 2H-NMR spectra of DMPC which had been labelled in a choline methylene group is also affected more by the [Arg4]pentagastrin than by pentagastrin.

  Abstract                 = {G protein-coupled receptors mediate biological signals by stimulating nucleotide exchange in heterotrimeric G proteins (Galphabetagamma). Receptor dimers have been proposed as the functional unit responsible for catalytic interaction with Galphabetagamma. To investigate whether a G protein-coupled receptor monomer can activate Galphabetagamma, we used the retinal photoreceptor rhodopsin and its cognate G protein transducin (G(t)) to determine the stoichiometry of rhodopsin/G(t) binding and the rate of catalyzed nucleotide exchange in G(t). Purified rhodopsin was prepared in dodecyl maltoside detergent solution. Rhodopsin was monomeric as concluded from fluorescence resonance energy transfer, copurification studies with fluorescent labeled and unlabeled rhodopsin, size exclusion chromatography, and multiangle laser light scattering. A 1:1 complex between light-activated rhodopsin and G(t) was found in the elution profiles, and one molecule of GDP was released upon complex formation. Analysis of the speed of catalytic rhodopsin/G(t) interaction yielded a maximum of approximately 50 G(t) molecules per second and molecule of activated rhodopsin. The bimolecular rate constant is close to the diffusion limit in the diluted system. The results show that the interaction of G(t) with an activated rhodopsin monomer is sufficient for fully functional G(t) activation. Although the activation rate in solution is at the physically possible limit, the rate in the native membrane is still 10-fold higher. This is likely attributable to the precise orientation of the G protein to the membrane surface, which enables a fast docking process preceding the actual activation step. Whether docking in membranes involves the formation of rhodopsin dimers or oligomers remains to be elucidated.},

  annotation = {We have shown previously that using a trifluoroethanol containing mobile phase provides a unique chromatographic selectivity. This is essential to derive molecular descriptors by HPLC which requires retention data from several systems. It also requires that the ionisation is suppressed so that retention times reflect the properties of the neutral molecules. Therefore the pH change of the mobile phase during gradient elution and its effect on the solute ionisation have been studied. During gradient elution of mixtures of ammonium acetate and butylammonium formate with trifluoroethanol as an organic modifier it was found that the pH was almost constant when the gradient started with a low pH. However, when the starting mobile phase pH was above 8 the pH dropped very quickly as the trifluoroethanol concentration increased in the mobile phase. The CHI descriptor (a retention index derived directly from gradient retention times) of several basic compounds as a function of starting mobile phase pH has been measured using trifluoroethanol gradient. The effect of the trifluoroethanol on the pK(a) change of the compounds has been investigated. The experimental data fit closely to a previously derived equation that describes gradient retention times as a function of mobile phase pH and analyte ionisation constant (pK(a)). This equation makes it possible to predict the CHI descriptor for ionisable compounds at various pH values. We have used butylamine for high pH mobile phase preparation as is more basic than ammonia and for many basic drugs the retention of the neutral form could be obtained directly (without extrapolation).

However, studies that are proving the benefit of small synthetic fusion peptides as components in drug delivery systems remain sporadic and there is a strong need to characterize and increase our understanding of the membrane fusion properties of these peptides. Many fusion studies have focused on the ability of free peptides in solution that mediate fusion between liposomes. For drug delivery purposes it is a necessity to attach the peptides to the surface of the liposome drug delivery carrier, without impairing the peptide functionality. Here we present the synthesis and characterization of a new diacylated derivative of the previously described fusion peptide GALA. Two myristoyl chains were attached to the GALA peptide through the 1,2-diamino propanoic acid (Dap) moiety, yielding the lipopeptide dimyristoyl-Dap-GALA (DMDGALA). We have investigated DMDGALA as a component in large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) and demonstrate pH-triggered fusion of peptide containing LUVs with stable target giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), which were used as simple mimics of cell membranes. The number of fusion events was large at pH 5.0, which is a physiologically relevant pH-range for a drug delivery system.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: A common practice in X-ray crystallographic structure refinement has been to model atomic displacements or thermal fluctuations as isotropic motions. Recent high-resolution data reveal, however, significant departures from isotropy, described by anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs) modeled for individual atoms. Yet, ADPs are currently reported for a limited set of structures, only. RESULTS: We present a comparative analysis of the experimentally reported ADPs and those theoretically predicted by the anisotropic network model (ANM) for a representative set of structures. The relative sizes of fluctuations along different directions are shown to agree well between experiments and theory, while the cross-correlations between the (x-, y- and z-) components of the fluctuations show considerable deviations. Secondary structure elements and protein cores exhibit more robust anisotropic characteristics compared to disordered or flexible regions. The deviations between experimental and theoretical data are comparable to those between sets of experimental ADPs reported for the same protein in different crystal forms. These results draw attention to the effects of crystal form and refinement procedure on experimental ADPs and highlight the potential utility of ANM calculations for consolidating experimental data or assessing ADPs in the absence of experimental data. AVAILABILITY: The ANM server at http://www.ccbb.pitt.edu/anm is upgraded to permit users to compute and visualize the theoretical ADPs for any PDB structure, thus providing insights into the anisotropic motions intrinsically preferred by equilibrium structures. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Two Supplementary Material files can be accessed at the journal website. The first presents the tabulated results from computations (Pearson correlations and KL distances with respect to experimental ADPs) reported for each of the 93 proteins in Set I (the averages over all proteins are presented above in Table 3). The second file consists of three sections: (A) detailed derivation of Equation (7), (B) analysis of the effect of ANM parameters on computed ADPs and identification of parameters that achieve optimal correlation with experiments and (C) description of the method for computing the tangential and radial components of equilibrium fluctuations.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: The Anisotropic Network Model (ANM) is a simple yet powerful model for normal mode analysis of proteins. Despite its broad use for exploring biomolecular collective motions, ANM has not been systematically evaluated to date. A lack of a convenient interface has been an additional obstacle for easy usage. RESULTS: ANM has been evaluated on a large set of proteins to establish the optimal model parameters that achieve the highest correlation with experimental data and its limits of accuracy and applicability. Residue fluctuations in globular proteins are shown to be more accurately predicted than those in nonglobular proteins, and core residues are more accurately described than solvent-exposed ones. Significant improvement in agreement with experiments is observed with increase in the resolution of the examined structure. A new server for ANM calculations is presented, which offers flexible options for controlling model parameters and output formats, interactive animation of collective modes and advanced graphical features.

  abstract    = {Allosteric communication is critical for protein function and cellular homeostasis, and it can be exploited as a strategy for drug design. However, unlike many protein-ligand interactions, the structural basis for the long-range communication that underlies allostery is not well understood. This lack of understanding is most evident in the case of classical allostery, in which a binding event in one protomer is sensed by a second symmetric protomer. A primary reason why study of interdomain signaling is challenging in oligomeric proteins is the difficulty in characterizing intermediate, singly bound species. Here, we use an NMR approach to isolate and characterize a singly ligated state ("lig1") of a homodimeric enzyme that is otherwise obscured by rapid exchange with apo and saturated forms. Mixed labeled dimers were prepared that simultaneously permit full population of the lig1 state and isotopic labeling of either protomer. Direct visualization of peaks from lig1 yielded site-specific ligand-state multiplets that provide a convenient format for assessing mechanisms of intersubunit communication from a variety of NMR measurements. We demonstrate this approach on thymidylate synthase from Escherichia coli, a homodimeric enzyme known to be half-the-sites reactive. Resolving the dUMP1 state shows that active site communication occurs not upon the first dUMP binding, but upon the second. Surprisingly, for many sites, dUMP1 peaks are found beyond the limits set by apo and dUMP2 peaks, indicating that binding the first dUMP pushes the enzyme ensemble to further conformational extremes than the apo or saturated forms. The approach used here should be generally applicable to homodimers.},

Quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSAR) have been used widely to relate biological activities as well as physicochemical properties to molecular structure features. A difficulty in this approach has been nonuniformity of parameter sets resulting in the inability to examine contributions across properties and data sets. Linear solvation energy relationships (LSER) developed by Kamlet and Taft successfully utilize a single set of parameters to correlate a wide range of biological, chemical and physical properties. We have replaced the empirical LSER solvatochromic parameters with theoretically determined parameters to permit greater ease in a priori property prediction. These TLSER descriptors have given good correlations and interpretations for some biological activities and physicochemical properties. This paper discusses the application of these descriptors to the gas phase acidity of some carboxylic acids, alcohols, silanols, anilines, hydrocarbons, and oximes. Good correlations and physical interpretations result.},

The three GB models, the Still, HCT, and modified analytical generalized Born models, were implemented in the computationally efficient gromacs package. The performance of each model was assessed from the backbone rms deviation from the native structure, the number of native hydrogen bonds retained in the simulation, and the experimental and calculated radius of gyration. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the results of the simulations. The rms deviation measure was found to be unable to distinguish the quality of the results obtained with the three different GB models, whereas the number of native hydrogen bonds and radius of gyration yielded a statistically meaningful discrimination among models. Our results suggest that, of the three, modified analytical generalized Born yields the best agreement between calculated and experimentally derived structures. More generally, our study highlights the need both to evaluate the effects of different variables on the results of simulations and to verify that the results of molecular dynamics simulations are statistically meaningful.},

  Abstract                 = {The electrostatic and shape complementarities between the crystal structures of dark rhodopsin and heterotrimeric transducin (Gt) have been evaluated by exhaustively sampling the roto-translational space of one protein with respect to the other. Structural complementarity, reliability, and consistency with in vitro evidence all converge in the same rhodopsin-Gt complex, showing that the functionally important R135 of the E/DRY motif is almost accessible to the C-terminus of Gt(alpha) already in the dark state. The main inference from this study is that activation of rhodopsin and Gt may be concurrent processes, consisting of conformational changes in a supramolecular complex formed prior to the light-induced activation of the photoreceptor.},

  Abstract                 = {All 20 single cysteine substitution mutants in the sequence Y136-M155 of bovine rhodopsin have been prepared and modified with a sulfhydryl-specific nitroxide reagent. This sequence contains the C-D interhelical loop, a transducin interaction site. The accessibilities of the attached nitroxides to collisions with paramagnetic probes in solution were determined, and the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra were analyzed, both in the dark and after photoexcitation. Accessibility data show that the rhodopsin polypeptide crosses an aqueous/hydrophobic boundary near V138 and H152. The nitroxide mobilities inferred from the spectra are consistent with a model where the C helix extends to at least residue C140, with much of the helix surface in contact with protein rather than lipid near the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane. Upon photoexcitation, electron paramagnetic resonance spectral changes are observed at sites on the putative C helix surface that are in contact with the protein and at specific sites in the C-D interhelical loop. A simple interpretation of these results is that photoexcitation involves a rigid body movement of the C helix relative to the others in the helix bundle.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular dynamics simulations based on the replica-exchange framework (REMD) are emerging as a useful tool to characterize the conformational variability that is intrinsic to most chemical and biological systems. In this work, it is shown that a simple extension of the replica-exchange method, known as Hamiltonian REMD, greatly facilitates the characterization of conformational equilibria across large energetic barriers, or in the presence of substantial entropic effects, overcoming some of the difficulties of REMD based on temperature alone. In particular, a comparative assessment of the HREMD and TREMD approaches was made, through computation of the gas-phase free-energy difference between the so-called D(2d) and S(4) states of tetrabutylammonium (TBA), an ionic compound of frequently used in biophysical studies of ion channels. Taking advantage of the greater efficiency of the HREMD scheme, the conformational equilibrium of TBA was characterized in a variety of conditions. Simulation of the gas-phase equilibrium in the 100-300 K range allowed us to compute the entropy difference between these states as well as to describe its temperature dependence. Through HREMD simulations of TBA in a water droplet, the effect of solvation on the conformational equilibrium was determined. Finally, the equilibrium of TBA in the context of a simplified model of the binding cavity of the KcsA potassium channel was simulated, and density maps for D(2d) and S(4) states analogous to those derived from X-ray crystallography were constructed. Overall, this work illustrates the potential of the HREMD approach in the context of computational drug design, ligand-receptor structural prediction and more generally, molecular recognition, where one of the most challenging issues remains to account for conformational flexibility as well for the solvation and entropic effects thereon.},

Magnetic dipolar interactions between spin labels attached to these residues revealed their proximity, and changes in their interaction upon rhodopsin light activation suggested a rigid body movement of helices relative to one another. Disulfide cross-linking of the helices prevented activation of transducin, which suggests the importance of this movement for activation of rhodopsin.},

With ring-substituted nitrobenzyl chlorides and bromides, a stepwise mechanism involving the intermediacy of the anion radical takes place. When slightly less electron- withdrawing substituents, such as nitrile or ester groups, are involved, the reaction occurs via a concerted electron transfer-bond breaking mechanism. This is also observed with the unsubstituted benzyl chloride and bromide as well as with 9-anthracenylmethyl chloride. The main factor then governing the thermodynamics and kinetics of the reductive cleavage is then the dissociation energy of the bond being broken. There is an excellent agreement between the predictions of the recently developed model of dissociative electron transfer and the experimental data both in terms of the quadratic character of the activation-driving force relationship and the magnitude of the intrinsic barrier. In this connection, procedures utilizing the difference in cyclic voltammetric peak potential between two compounds bearing the same nucleofugal group to estimate the difference in their bond dissociation energies are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {As sketched in Fig. 1, a current molecular dynamics computer simulation of a lipid bilayer fails to capture significant features of the macroscopic system, including long wavelength undulations. Such fluctuations are intrinsically connected to the value of the macroscopic (or thermodynamic) surface tension (cf. Eqs. 1 and 9; for a related treatment, see Brochard et al., 1975, 1976). Consequently, the surface tension that might be evaluated in an MD simulation should not be expected to equal the surface tension obtained from macroscopic measurements. Put another way, the largest of the three simulations presented here contained over 16,000 atoms and required substantial computer time to complete, but modeled a system of only 36 lipids per side. From this perspective it is not surprising that the system is not at the thermodynamic limit. An important practical consequence of this effect is that simulations with fluctuating area should be carried out with a nonzero applied surface tension (gamma 0 of Fig. 2) even when the macroscopic tension is zero, or close to zero. Computer simulations at fixed surface area, which can explicitly determine pressure anisotropy at the molecular level, should ultimately lend insight into the value of gamma 0, including its dependence on lipid composition and other membrane components. As we have noted and will describe further in separate publications (Feller et al., 1996; Feller et al., manuscript in preparation), surface tensions obtained from simulations can be distorted by inadequate initial conditions and convergence, and are sensitive to potential energy functions, force truncation methods, and system size; it is not difficult, in fact, to tune terms in the potential energy function so as to yield surface tensions close to zero. This is why parameters should be tested extensively on simpler systems, for example, monolayers. The estimates of gamma 0 that we have presented here should be regarded as qualitative, and primarily underscore the assertion that the surface tension of a microscopically flat, simulation-sized patch is significantly greater than zero. As the simulation cell length increases, the surface tension that would be evaluated (or should be applied) decreases; in the limit of micrometer-sized simulation cells, gamma would approach zero or its appropriate thermodynamic value. The theories presented here also imply that the estimation of bilayer surface tension from monolayer data should take the degree of flatness into account. These conclusions are independent of the precise values of parameters such as bending constants. In conclusion, from the simulator's perspective, the question "What is the surface tension of a bilayer?" is better phrased as "What is the value of the applied surface tension necessary to simulate a particular experimental system with a given number of lipids?" As we have shown, the answer to the second question varies, but it should not be assumed a priori to equal zero.},

Surprisingly, the x-ray crystal structure of the active Meta-II state has a 180Â° rotation about the long-axis of the retinal polyene chain.

However it can be asked whether these calculated conformations provide good representatives for these intermediates. In this study, we use ENI to generate conformational transition intermediates between the open form and the closed form of adenylate kinase (AK). Based on C(alpha)-only intermediates, we construct atomic intermediates by grafting all the atoms of known AK structures onto the C(alpha) atoms and then perform CHARMM energy minimization to remove steric conflicts and optimize these intermediate structures. We compare the energy profiles for all intermediates from both the CHARMM force-field and from knowledge-based energy functions. We find that the CHARMM energies can successfully capture the two energy minima representing the open AK and closed AK forms, while the energies computed from the knowledge-based energy functions can detect the local energy minimum representing the closed AK form and show some general features of the transition pathway with a somewhat similar energy profile as the CHARMM energies. The combinatorial extension structural alignment (Shindyalov et al., 1998;11:739-747) and the k-means clustering algorithm are then used to show that known PDB structures closely resemble computed intermediates along the transition pathway.

Although there is general agreement that amphiphilicity is important for membrane-interface binding, an unanswered question is its importance relative to simple hydrophobicity-driven partitioning. We have examined this fundamental question using measurements of the interfacial partitioning of a family of 17-residue amidated-acetylated peptides into both neutral and anionic lipid vesicles. Composed only of Ala, Leu, and Gln residues, the amino acid sequences of the peptides were varied to change peptide amphiphilicity without changing total hydrophobicity. We found that peptide helicity in water and interface increased linearly with hydrophobic moment, as did the favorable peptide partitioning free energy. This observation provides simple tools for designing amphipathic helical peptides. Finally, our results show that helical amphiphilicity is far more important for interfacial binding than simple hydrophobicity.},

  abstract    = {Cyclic lipopeptides act against a variety of plant pathogens and are thus highly efficient crop-protection agents. Some pesticides contain Bacillus subtilis strains that produce lipopeptide families, such as surfactins (SF), iturins (IT), and fengycins (FE). The antimicrobial activity of these peptides is mainly mediated by permeabilizing cellular membranes. We used a fluorescence-lifetime based leakage assay to examine the effect of individual lipid components in model membranes on lipopeptide activity. Leakage induction by FE was strongly inhibited by cholesterol (CHOL) as well as by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and -glycerol (PG) lipids. Already moderate amounts of CHOL increased the tolerable FE content in membranes by an order of magnitude to 0.5 FE per PCÂ + CHOL. This indicates reduced FE-lipid demixing and aggregation, which is known to be required for membrane permeabilization and explains the strong inhibition by CHOL. Ergosterol (ERG) had a weak antagonistic effect. This confirms results of microbiological tests and agrees with the fungicidal activity and selectivity of FE. SF is known to be much less selective in its antimicrobial action. In line with this, liposome leakage by SF was little affected by sterols and PE. Interestingly, PG increased SF activity and changed its leakage mechanism toward all-or-none, suggesting more specific, larger, and/or longer-lived defect structures. This may be because of the reduced energetic cost of locally accumulating anionic SF in an anionic lipid matrix. IT was found largely inactive in our assays. B.Â subtilis QST713 produces the lipopeptides in a ratio of 6Â mol SF: 37Â mol FE: 57Â mol IT. Leakage induced by this native mixture was inhibited by CHOL and PE, but unaffected by ERG and by PG in the absence of PE. Note that fungi contain anionic lipids, but little PE. Hence, our data explain the strong, fungicidal activity and selectivity of B.Â subtilis QST713 lipopeptides.},

  Abstract                 = {It has been shown that rhodopsin forms an oligomer in the shape of long double rows of monomers. Because of the importance of rhodopsin as a template for all G protein-coupled receptors, its dimeric, tetrameric and higher-oligomeric structures also provide a useful pattern for similar structures in GPCRs. New experimental data published recently are discussed in the context of a proposed model of the rhodopsin oligomer 1N3M deposited in the protein data bank. The new rhodopsin structure at 2.2 A resolution with all residues resolved as well as an electron cryomicroscopy structure from 2D crystals of rhodopsin are in agreement with the 1N3M model. Accommodation of movement of transmembrane helix VI, regarded as a major event during the activation of rhodopsin, in a steady structure of the oligomer is also discussed. [Figure: see text].

  Abstract                 = {For years, conventional drug design at G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) has mainly focused on the inhibition of a single receptor at a usually well-defined ligand-binding site. The recent discovery of more and more physiologically relevant GPCR dimers/oligomers suggests that selectively targeting these complexes or designing small molecules that inhibit receptor-receptor interactions might provide new opportunities for novel drug discovery. To uncover the fundamental mechanisms and dynamics governing GPCR dimerization/oligomerization, it is crucial to understand the dynamic process of receptor-receptor association, and to identify regions that are suitable for selective drug binding. This minireview highlights current progress in the development of increasingly accurate dynamic molecular models of GPCR oligomers based on structural, biochemical, and biophysical information that has recently appeared in the literature. In view of this new information, there has never been a more exciting time for computational research into GPCRs than at present. Information-driven modern molecular models of GPCR complexes are expected to efficiently guide the rational design of GPCR oligomer-specific drugs, possibly allowing researchers to reach for the high-hanging fruits in GPCR drug discovery, i.e. more potent and selective drugs for efficient therapeutic interventions.},

Since heterodimerization appears to play a role in modulating agonist affinity, efficacy and/or trafficking properties, the molecular models of GPCRs required to understand receptor function must consider these oligomerization hypotheses. To advance knowledge in this field, we present here a computational approach based on correlated mutation analysis and the structural information contained in three-dimensional molecular models of the transmembrane regions of GPCRs built using the rhodopsin crystal structure as a template. The new subtractive correlated mutation method reveals likely heterodimerization interfaces amongst the different alternatives for the positioning of two tightly packed bundles of seven transmembrane domains next to each other in contact heterodimers of GPCRs. Predictions are applied to GPCRs in the class of opioid receptors. However, in the absence of a known structure of any GPCR dimer, the features of the method and predictions are also illustrated and analyzed for a dimeric complex of known structure.},

The dynamic mechanisms of such signaling assemblies are unknown. To gain some insight into properties of GPCR dimers that may be relevant to functional mechanisms, we study their current structural prototype, rhodopsin. We have carried out nanosecond time-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of a rhodopsin dimer and compared the results to the monomer simulated in the same type of bilayer membrane model composed of an equilibrated unit cell of hydrated palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidyl choline (POPC). The dynamic representation of the homo-dimer reveals the location of structural changes in several regions of the monomeric subunits. These changes appear to be more pronounced at the dimerization interface that had been shown to be involved in the activation process [Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 102:17495, 2005]. The results are consistent with a model of GPCR activation that involves allosteric modulation through a single GPCR subunit per dimer.},

The structural underpinnings of these novel functional insights are still not clear, as current experimental techniques have not yet succeeded in identifying the dimerization interfaces between GPCR monomers. Two computational approaches have recently been designed in our lab to provide reasonable three-dimensional (3D) molecular models of the transmembrane (TM) regions of GPCR dimers based on a combination of the structural information of receptor monomers and analyses of correlated mutations in receptor families. The modeling of GPCR heterodimers has been described recently. We present here a related approach for modeling of GPCR homodimers that identifies the interfaces in the most likely configurations of the complexes. The approach is illustrated for the three cloned opioid receptor subtypes (OPRD, OPRM, and OPRK).},

The significance of such structures is based on the recent realization that ligand-dependent signaling by GPCRs is not necessarily transduced to the G protein by receptor monomers, but possibly by GPCR dimers or even oligomers that function as dynamic macromolecular assemblies. In addition, recent evidence that GPCR hetero-oligomerization can produce signaling units with unexpected combinations of pharmacological properties suggests entirely new methods for developing successful drugs. The dynamic mechanisms of these signaling assemblies remain to be elucidated. The development of increasingly accurate dynamic molecular models of GPCR dimers is expected to produce a more complete structural context for understanding the molecular mechanisms of GPCR function, and to aid in drug discovery.},

  Abstract                 = {To achieve a structural context for the analysis of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) oligomers, molecular modeling must be used to predict the corresponding interaction interfaces. The task is complicated by the paucity of detailed structural data at atomic resolution, and the large number of possible modes in which the bundles of seven transmembrane (TM) segments of the interacting GPCR monomers can be packed together into dimers and/or higher-order oligomers. Approaches and tools offered by bioinformatics can be used to reduce the complexity of this task and, combined with computational modeling, can serve to yield testable predictions for the structural properties of oligomers. Most of the bioinformatics methods take advantage of the evolutionary relation that exists among GPCRs, as expressed in their sequences and measurable in the common elements of their structural and functional features. These common elements are responsible for the presence of detectable patterns of motifs and correlated mutations evident from the alignment of the sequences of these complex biological systems. The decoding of these patterns in terms of structural and functional determinants can provide indications about the most likely interfaces of dimerization/oligomerization of GPCRs. We review here the main approaches from bioinformatics, enhanced by computational molecular modeling, that have been used to predict likely interfaces of dimerization/oligomerization of GPCRs, and compare results from their application to rhodopsin-like GPCRs. A compilation of the most frequently predicted GPCR oligomerization interfaces points to specific regions of TMs 4-6.},

  abstract    = {The addition of hydrogen atoms to models or experimental structures of proteins that contain only non-hydrogen atoms is a common step in crystallographic structure refinement, in theoretical studies of proteins, and in protein structure prediction. Accurate prediction of the hydrogen positions is essential, since they constitute around half of the atoms in proteins and hence contribute significantly to their energetics. Many computational tools exist for predicting hydrogen positions, although to date no quantitative comparison has been made of their accuracy or efficiency. Here we take advantage of the recent increase in ultra-high-resolution X-ray crystal structures (< 0.9 A resolution), as well as of a number of relatively high-resolution neutron diffraction structures (< 1.8 A resolution), to compare the quality of the predictions generated by a large set of commonly used methods. These include CHARMM, CNS, GROMACS, MCCE, MolProbity, WHAT IF, and X-PLOR. The hydrogen atoms that lack a rotational degree of freedom are mostly, but not always, accurately predicted. For hydrogens with a rotational degree of freedom, all the methods give much less accurate predictions. The predictions for the hydroxyl hydrogens are analyzed in detail, particularly those buried within the protein, and some explanation is provided for the errors observed. The results provide a means to make informed decisions regarding the choice and implementation of methodologies for placing hydrogens on structures of proteins. They also point to shortcomings in current force fields and suggest the need for improved descriptions of hydrogen bonding energetics.},

The recent elucidation of the structure of NaK, an ion channel that conducts both Na+ and K+ ions, offers an opportunity to test the various hypotheses that have been put forward to explain the selectivity of K+ ion channels. We test the snug-fit, field strength and over-coordination hypotheses by comparing their predictions to the results of classical molecular dynamics simulations of the K+ selective channel KcsA and the less selective channel NaK embedded in lipid bilayers. Our results are incompatible with the so-called strong variant of the snug-fit hypothesis but are consistent with the over-coordination hypothesis and neither confirm nor refute the field-strength hypothesis. We also find that the ions and waters in the NaK selectivity filter unexpectedly move to a new conformation in seven K+ simulations: the two K+ ions rapidly move from site S4 to S2 and from the cavity to S4. At the same time the selectivity filter narrows around sites S1 and S2 and the carbonyl oxygen atoms rotate 20{degrees} to 40{degrees} inwards towards the ion. These motions diminish the large structural differences between the crystallographic structures of NaK and KcsA and appear to allow the binding of ions to S2 of NaK at physiological temperature. 10.1529/biophysj.108.132035},

  Abstract                 = {Voltage-sensitive ion channels open and close in response to changes in transmembrane (TM) potential caused by the motion of the S4 voltage sensors. These sensors are alpha-helices that include four or more positively charged amino acids, most commonly arginine. The so-called paddle model, based on the high-resolution structure of the KvAP K+ channel [Jiang, et al. (2003) Nature 423, 33-41], posits that the S4 sensors move within the membrane bilayer in response to TM voltage changes. Direct exposure of S4 sensors to lipid is contrary to the classical expectation that the dielectric contrast between the membrane hydrocarbon core and water presents an insurmountable energetic penalty to burial of electric charges. Nevertheless, recent experiments have shown that a helix with the sequence of KvAP S4 can be inserted across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. To reconcile this result with the classical energetics argument, we have carried out a molecular dynamics simulation of an isolated TM S4 helix in a lipid bilayer. The simulation reveals a stabilizing hydrogen-bonded network of water and lipid phosphates around the arginines that reduces the effective thickness of the bilayer hydrocarbon core to approximately 10 A in the vicinity of the helix. It suggests that bilayer phospholipids can adapt locally to strongly perturbing protein elements, causing the phospholipids to become a structural extension of the protein.},

  abstract             = {A direct conformational clustering and mapping approach for peptide conformations based on backbone dihedral angles has been developed and applied to compare conformational sampling of Met-enkephalin using two molecular dynamics (MD) methods. Efficient clustering in dihedrals has been achieved by evaluating all combinations resulting from independent clustering of each dihedral angle distribution, thus resolving all conformational substates. In contrast, Cartesian clustering was unable to accurately distinguish between all substates. Projection of clusters on dihedral principal component (PCA) subspaces did not result in efficient separation of highly populated clusters. However, representation in a nonlinear metric by Sammon mapping was able to separate well the 48 highest populated clusters in just two dimensions. In addition, this approach also allowed us to visualize the transition frequencies between clusters efficiently. Significantly, higher transition frequencies between more distinct conformational substates were found for a recently developed biasing-potential replica exchange MD simulation method allowing faster sampling of possible substates compared to conventional MD simulations. Although the number of theoretically possible clusters grows exponentially with peptide length, in practice, the number of clusters is only limited by the sampling size (typically much smaller), and therefore the method is well suited also for large systems. The approach could be useful to rapidly and accurately evaluate conformational sampling during MD simulations, to compare different sampling strategies and eventually to detect kinetic bottlenecks in folding pathways. {\copyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  Abstract                 = {We developed a software package (RedMD) to perform molecular dynamics simulations and normal mode analysis of reduced models of proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes. With RedMD one can perform molecular dynamics simulations in a microcanonical ensemble, with Berendsen and Langevin thermostats, and with Brownian dynamics. We provide force field and topology generators which are based on the one-bead per residue/nucleotide elastic network model and its extensions. The user can change the force field parameters with the command line options that are passed to generators. Also, the generators can be modified, for example, to add new potential energy functions. Normal mode analysis tool is available for elastic or anisotropic network models. The program is written in C and C++ languages and the structure/topology of a molecule is based on an XML format. OpenMP technology for shared-memory architectures was used for code parallelization. The code is distributed under GNU public licence and available at http://bionano.icm.edu.pl/software/.

  Abstract                 = {We present an implementation of generalized Born implicit solvent all-atom classical molecular dynamics (MD) within the AMBER program package that runs entirely on CUDA enabled NVIDIA graphics processing units (GPUs). We discuss the algorithms that are used to exploit the processing power of the GPUs and show the performance that can be achieved in comparison to simulations on conventional CPU clusters. The implementation supports three different precision models in which the contributions to the forces are calculated in single precision floating point arithmetic but accumulated in double precision (SPDP), or everything is computed in single precision (SPSP) or double precision (DPDP). In addition to performance, we have focused on understanding the implications of the different precision models on the outcome of implicit solvent MD simulations. We show results for a range of tests including the accuracy of single point force evaluations and energy conservation as well as structural properties pertainining to protein dynamics. The numerical noise due to rounding errors within the SPSP precision model is sufficiently large to lead to an accumulation of errors which can result in unphysical trajectories for long time scale simulations. We recommend the use of the mixed-precision SPDP model since the numerical results obtained are comparable with those of the full double precision DPDP model and the reference double precision CPU implementation but at significantly reduced computational cost. Our implementation provides performance for GB simulations on a single desktop that is on par with, and in some cases exceeds, that of traditional supercomputers.},

  Abstract                 = {When imagining to monitor animal cells through a microscope with resolution at the molecular level, a salient attribute of their surfaces will be the abundance of glycan chains. They present galactosides at their termini widely extending like tentacles into the extracellular space. Their spatial accessibility and their potential for structural variability endow especially these glycan parts with capacity to act as docking points for molecular sensors (sugar receptors such as lectins). Binding and ligand clustering account for transmission of post-binding signals into the cell interior. The range of triggered activities has turned plant lectins into popular tools in cell biology and immunology. Potential for clinical application has been investigated rigorously only in recent years. As documented in vitro and in vivo for the galactoside-specific mistletoe lectin, its apparent immunomodulatory capacity reflected in upregulation of production of proinflammatory cytokines will not necessarily be clinically favorable but a double-edged sword. In fact, lectin application has been shown to stimulate tumor growth in cell lines, histocultures of human tumors and in two animal models using chemical carcinogenesis or tumor transplantation. When testing immunological effects of the endogenous lectin galectin-1, protection against disorders mediated by activated T cells came up for consideration. Elimination of these cells via CD7-dependent induction of apoptosis, and a shift to the Th2 response by the galectin, are factors to ameliorate disease states. This result encourages further efforts with other galectins. Functional redundancy, synergism, diversity or antagonism among galectins are being explored to understand the actual role of this class of endogenous lectins in inflammation. Regardless of the results of further preclinical testing for galectin-1, these two case studies break new ground in our understanding how glycans as ligands for lectins convey reactivity to immune cells, with impact on the course of a tumor or autoimmune disease.},

The analysis of diffusion data obtained in powder samples and a method for liposome curvature correction are presented. At 322 K POPC has a diffusion constant of (8.6 +/- 0.2) x 10(-12) m(2)/s when dehydrated (8.2 waters/lipid) and (1.9 +/- 0.1) x 10(-11) m(2)/s in excess water. The diffusion constant of water in dehydrated POPC was found to be (4.7 +/- 0.1) x 10(-10) m(2)/s. The radius of curvature is 21 +/- 2 microm for the dehydrated sample and 4.5 +/- 0.5 microm for POPC sample containing excess water. The activation energies of diffusion are 40.6 +/- 0.4 kJ/mole for dehydrated POPC, 30.7 +/- 0.9 kJ/mole for POPC with excess water, and 28.6 +/- 1.5 kJ/mole for water in dehydrated POPC. The diffusion constants and activation energies for a sample of POPC/ibuprofen/water (1:0.56:15) were also measured. The ibuprofen, which locates in the lipid-water interface, diffuses faster than POPC but has a slightly higher activation energy of lateral diffusion. Within certain restrictions, PFG-MAS NMR provides a useful method for characterizing membrane organization and mobility.},

Most techniques from gradient NMR spectroscopy on solution samples are directly applicable to membrane samples subjected to magic angle spinning (MAS). Gradient-enhanced homo- and heteronuclear chemical shift correlation techniques were used to make resonance assignments. Gradient NOESY experiments provide insight into the location and dynamics of lipids, ibuprofen and water. Application of gradients not only reduces experiment time but also the t(1) noise in the multi-dimensional spectra.

Nonpolar solutes cause a concerted decrease in the average length and angle of the water-water hydrogen bonds in the first hydration shell, while polar and ionic solutes have the opposite effect. This is due to changes in the amounts, relative to bulk water, of two populations of hydrogen bonds: one with shorter and more linear bonds and the other with longer and more bent bonds. Heat capacity changes were calculated from these changes in water structure using a random network model equation of state. The calculated changes account for observed differences in Delta C-p(hyd) for the various solutes. The simulations provide a unified picture of hydrophobic and polar hydration, and both a structural and thermodynamic explanation of the opposite signs of Delta C- p(hyd) observed for polar and nonpolar solutes.},

Evidence against nucleophilic solvent participation in the tert-butyl chloride transition state and for increased hydrogen bond donation to the 1- adamantyl chloride solvolysis transition state},
  year       = {2001},
  pages      = {10877-10883},
  annotation = {Despite theoretical calculations to the contrary, it has been argued that the I-adamantyl cation is more stable than the tert-butyl cation in media of high dielectric constant. This argument has been utilized to suggest that the higher rate of solvolysis of tert-butyl chloride in aqueous ethanol is evidence for nucleophilic solvent participation in this classic reaction. Further, in 'more highly ionizing' solvents, the rate of 1-adamantyl chloride is nearly the same as that of tert- butyl chloride, which is interpreted as a manifestation of the relative stabilities of the cations. However, the evidence cited does not explain the increased sensitivity of the rate of solvolysis of 1-adamantyl chloride over tert-butyl chloride to solvents which are better able to donate hydrogen bonds. The hypothesis developed here is that 1-adamantyl chloride solvolysis is assisted by hydrogen bond donation departing chloride ion to a greater extent than that of tert-butyl chloride solvolysis, most likely due to lessened steric interactions in a developing pyramidal cation. This hypothesis is supported by multiparameter solvent effect factor analyses utilizing the KOMPH2 equation which, in addition, quantifies the important role of ground-state destabilization due to strong solvent-solvent interactions. An important result from the good correlation of free energies of transfer of the tert- butyl chloride solvolysis transition state is that there is no change in mechanism, and, in particular, no nucleophilic participation even in non-hydroxylic basic solvents. The equation is also applied to the case of dimethylsulfonium. ion solvolyses where the tert-butyl salt reacts substantially faster than the 1-adamantyl salt in ethanol and the gas phase. The decreased rate of the former in hydrogen bond donating solvents relative to the gas phase is as yet unclear. Solvent N values that were generated to characterize solvent nucleophilicity are shown not to be correlated by measures of solvent basicity but rather by the negative of measures of solvent hydrogen bond donor ability.},

  annotation = {Solvent effects on reactions have been successfully subjected to a factor analysis using as parameters the Kirkwood-Onsager dielectric function, the Hildebrand cohesive energy density, and the chloride ion and potassium ion solvent transference data after subtraction of the K-O and CED contributions. The coefficients of the parameters provide information about the change in dipole moment, the volume change, and the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor requirements in the reaction. Application to the rates of solvolysis of tert-butyl chloride reveals not only the increased dipole moment in the transition state and increased hydrogen bonding (presumably to the leaving chloride ion), but to the overwhelming contribution of ground state destabilization in solvents with high CED. The thermally induced 3,3-shift of allyl vinyl ether (the Claisen rearrangement) responds only to the solvent CED and hydrogen bond donor ability and not to the K-O function. Consistent with this analysis are secondary deuterium kinetic isotope effects at the bond breaking and making sites that reveal little change in transition state structure in more aqueous media.},

In addition to detecting basal precoupling of the receptors to Galpha-, Gbeta- and Ggamma-subunits, BRET measured very rapid ligand-induced increases in the interaction between receptor and Galphabetagamma-complexes (t(1/2) approximately 300 ms) followed by a slower (several minutes) decrease, reflecting receptor desensitization. The agonist-promoted increase in GPCR-Gbetagamma interaction was highly dependent on the identity of the Galpha-subunit present in the complex. Therefore, this G protein-activity biosensor provides a novel tool to directly probe the dynamics and selectivity of receptor-mediated, G-protein activation-deactivation cycles that could be advantageously used to identify ligands for orphan GPCRs.},

  Abstract                 = {Dermaseptin B2 (Drs B2) is a 33-residue-long cationic, alpha-helical antimicrobial peptide endowed with membrane-damaging activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, and protozoa, but its precise mechanism of action remained ill-defined. A detailed characterization of peptide-membrane interactions of Drs B2 was undertaken in comparison with a C-terminal truncated analogue, [1-23]-Drs B2, that was virtually inactive on bacteria despite retaining the cationic charge of the full-length peptide. Both peptides were tested on living cells using membrane permeabilization assays and on large unilamellar and multilamellar phospholipid vesicles composed of binary lipid mixtures by dye leakage assay, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and differential scanning calorimetry and also on SDS micelles using NMR spectroscopy. The results indicate that Drs B2 induces a strong perturbation of anionic lipid bilayers, resides at the hydrocarbon core-water interface, parallel to the plane of the membrane, and interacts preferentially with the polar head groups and glycerol backbone region of the anionic phospholipids, as well as the region of the lipid acyl chain near the bilayer surface. The interfacial location of Drs B2 induces a positive curvature of the bilayer and clustering of anionic lipids, consistent with a carpet mechanism, that may lead to the formation of mixed peptide-phospholipid toroidal, transient pores and membrane permeation/disruption once a threshold peptide accumulation is reached. In constrast, the truncated [1-23]-Drs B2 analogue interacts at the head group level without penetrating and perturbing the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. NMR study in SDS micelles showed that [1-23]-Drs B2 adopts a well-defined helix encompassing residues 2-20, whereas Drs B2 was previously found to adopt helical structures interrupted around the Val(9)-Gly(10) segment. Thus the antibacterial activity of Drs B2 depends markedly on a threshold number of hydrophobic residues to be present on both extremities of the helix. In a membrane environment with a strong positive curvature strain, Drs B2 can adopt a flexible helix-hinge-helix structure that facilitates the concomitant insertion of the strongly hydrophobic N- and C-termini of the peptide into the acyl core of the membrane.},

  Abstract                 = {Mg(II)-porphyrin-ligand and (bacterio)chlorophyl-ligand coordination interactions have been studied by solution and solid-state MAS NMR spectroscopy. (1)H, (13)C and (15)N coordination shifts due to ring currents, electronic perturbations and structural effects are resolved for imidazole (Im) and 1-methylimidazole (1-MeIm) coordinated axially to Mg(II)-OEP and (B)Chl a. As a consequence of a single axial coordination of Im or 1-MeIm to the Mg(II) ion, 0.9-5.2 ppm (1)H, 0.2-5.5 ppm (13)C and 2.1-27.2 ppm (15)N coordination shifts were measured for selectively labeled [1,3-(15)N]-Im, [1,3-(15)N,2-(13)C]-Im and [1,3-(15)N,1,2-(13)C]-1-MeIm. The coordination shifts depend on the distance of the nuclei to the porphyrin plane and the perturbation of the electronic structure. The signal intensities in the (1)H NMR spectrum reveal a five-coordinated complex, and the isotropic chemical shift analysis shows a close analogy with the electronic structure of the BChl a-histidine in natural light harvesting 2 complexes. The line broadening of the ligand responses support the complementary IR data and provide evidence for a dynamic coordination bond in the complex.},

Presensitized mice were treated by daily i.p. injections of a mixture of three long overlapping peptides (44- to 60-mer) spanning the entire PLA2 molecule (100 microg/peptide) for 6 consecutive days. This therapeutic approach induced a sharp drop in PLA2-specific IgE, an increase in specific IgG2a, and a marked T cell hyporesponsiveness. T cell cytokine secretion was characterized by a shift from a Th2 to a Th1 profile. Prophylactic treatment of naive mice with long peptides prior to sensitization with PLA2 induced a comparable modulation of B and T cell responses. Upon i.p. challenge with native PLA2, presensitized mice treated with the long peptide mixture were fully protected from anaphylaxis. This indicated that allergen-derived long overlapping peptides were safe and able to modulate an established Th2 response or to prevent its development. Furthermore, long peptide-based immunotherapy provided clinical protection against anaphylaxis, thus appearing as a promising approach of the therapy of allergic diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {Exposure to ultraviolet light, especially UVB wavelengths, can impair immune responses in animals and humans. It is remarkable that this immunomodulation is not restricted to the exposed skin but is also found at other sites, i.e. systemic (distant) immunosuppression. A frequently proposed hypothesis is that UVB exposure inhibits, specifically, T helper 1 (Th1)-mediated immune responses. The major reason for this is that contact hypersensitivity (CHS) and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH), both Th1-mediated immune responses, are very sensitive to UVB. For this reason these models are frequently used for photoimmunology studies. In the present study, the effects of UVB exposure were investigated in classical models for Th1-mediated immunity, i.e. CHS models in which picrylchloride or oxazolone were used as low-molecular-weight chemical antigens. In these models, CHS responsiveness and cytokines were measured, the latter by both reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The CHS responses to both contact sensitizers (picrylchloride and oxazolone) were suppressed significantly by pre-exposure to repeated suberythemal UVB exposure. Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-4, but not IL-10, were detectable in spleen and draining lymph nodes of sensitized BALB/c mice. Repeated UVB exposure prior to sensitization at a distant locus inhibited both IFN-gamma and IL-12 but not IL-4. In BALB/c mice sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA) in the absence of complete Freund's adjuvant, a model for Th2-mediated immunity, OVA-specific serum IgE and cytokine profiles in the spleen were analysed. Sensitization did lead to a significant increase in OVA-specific IgE serum titres. Pre-exposure to UVB resulted in a decreased OVA-specific IgE serum titre. Both RT-PCR and ELISA showed increased levels of IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 in the spleens of OVA-sensitized mice. The production of IFN-gamma and IL-4 was not affected by UVB pre-exposure. In contrast, the production of IL-10 was significantly increased. This was probably caused by an up-regulation of Th2 cells. It is remarkable that IFN-gamma is significantly suppressed by UVB in Th1-mediated immune reactions but not in Th2-mediated immune reactions where it even appears to increase. IL-10, which is up-regulated by UVB pre-exposure and produced by, among others, Th2 cells, may represent a shift from Th1- to Th2-mediated immune mechanisms. However, IL-10 can also inhibit Th2 responses, which might be the reason for a decreased IgE titre in the Th2 model. From the results of this study it is concluded that UVB exposure prior to sensitization/immunization not only inhibits Th1-mediated but also Th2-mediated immune responses.},

The overall quality of the structure ensemble is good (backbone r.m.s. deviation of 0.48 \r{A}) and agrees well with previously determined X-ray structures. Furthermore, measurements in more native-like small phospholipid bicelles indicate that the protein structure is the same as in detergent micelles, suggesting that environment-specific effects are minimal when using mild detergents. We use our case study as a platform to discuss the feasibility of similar solution NMR studies for other 7TM proteins, including members of the family of G proteinÃ¢ÂÂcoupled receptors.},

The low barriers to torsional rotation about C-C bonds that link the cis-locked double bonds with the methylene carbons between them are responsible for this unusual flexibility.

  Abstract                 = {The composition of the lipid matrix is critical for function of membrane proteins. Perhaps one of the best studied examples is the function of the G-protein-coupled membrane receptor (GPCR) rhodopsin which is located in membranes with high content of phospholipids with polyunsaturated docosahexaenoic acid chains (DHA, 22:6n-3). Technological advances enabled a more detailed study of structure and dynamics of DHA chains and their interaction with rhodopsin. It was established that polyunsaturated DHA differs from saturated and monounsaturated hydrocarbon chains by far more rapid structural conversions. Furthermore, DHA chains tend to have higher density near the lipid/water interface while density of saturated chains is higher in the bilayer center. The interface of rhodopsin has a small number of sites for tighter interaction with DHA. Polyunsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines accumulate preferentially near the protein. Surprisingly, the high conformational freedom of most DHA chains is not measurably reduced upon interaction with rhodopsin. While some observations point at an involvement of continuum elastic properties of membranes in modulation of rhodopsin function, there is growing evidence for a role of weakly specific DHA-rhodopsin interactions.},

  abstract             = {Abstract: Skin secretions of numerous Australian tree frogs contain antimicrobial peptides that form part of the host defense mechanism against bacterial infection. The mode of action of these antibiotics is thought to be lysis of infectious organisms via cell membrane disruption, on the basis of vesicle-encapsulated dye leakage data [Ambroggio et al. (2005) Biophys. J. 89, 18741881]. A detailed understanding of the interaction of these peptides with bacterial membranes at a molecular level, however, is critical to their development as novel antibacterial therapeutics. We focus on four of these peptides, aurein 1.2, citropin 1.1, maculatin 1.1, and caerin 1.1, which exist as random coil in aqueous solution but have ÃÂ±-helical secondary structure in membrane mimetic environments. In our earlier solid-state NMR studies, only neutral bilayers of the zwitterionic phospholipid dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) were used. Deuterated DMPC (d54-DMPC) was used to probe the effect of the peptides on the order of the lipid acyl chains and dynamics of the phospholipid headgroups by deuterium and 31P NMR, respectively. In this report we demonstrate several important differences when anionic phospholipid is included in model membranes. Peptidemembrane interactions were characterized using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Changes in phospholipid motions and membrane binding information provided additional insight into the action of these antimicrobial peptides. While this set of peptides has significant C- and N-terminal sequence homology, they vary in their mode of membrane interaction. The longer peptides caerin and maculatin exhibited properties that were consistent with transmembrane insertion while citropin and aurein demonstrated membrane disruptive mechanisms. Moreover, aurein was unique with greater perturbation of neutral versus anionic membranes. The results are consistent with a surface interaction for aurein 1.2 and pore formation rather than membrane lysis by the longer peptides.},

  Abstract                 = {PDZ domains (PDZs), the most common interaction domain proteins, play critical roles in many cellular processes. PDZs perform their job by binding specific protein partners. However, they are very promiscuous, binding to more than one protein, yet selective at the same time. We examined the binding related dynamics of various PDZs to have insight about their specificity and promiscuity. We used full atomic normal mode analysis and a modified coarse-grained elastic network model to compute the binding related dynamics. In the latter model, we introduced specificity for each single parameter constant and included the solvation effect implicitly. The modified model, referred to as specific-Gaussian Network Model (s-GNM), highlights some interesting differences in the conformational changes of PDZs upon binding to Class I or Class II type peptides. By clustering the residue fluctuation profiles of PDZs, we have shown: (i) binding selectivities can be discriminated from their dynamics, and (ii) the dynamics of different structural regions play critical roles for Class I and Class II specificity. s-GNM is further tested on a dual-specific PDZ which showed only Class I specificity when a point mutation exists on the betaA-betaB loop. We observe that the binding dynamics change consistently in the mutated and wild type structures. In addition, we found that the binding induced fluctuation profiles can be used to discriminate the binding selectivity of homolog structures. These results indicate that s-GNM can be a powerful method to study the changes in binding selectivities for mutant or homolog PDZs.},

Since the cloning of the first receptors more than a decade ago, extensive experimental work has uncovered multiple aspects of their function and challenged many traditional paradigms. However, it is only recently that we are beginning to gain insight into some of the most fundamental questions in the molecular function of this class of receptors. How can, for example, so many chemically diverse hormones, neurotransmitters, and other signaling molecules activate receptors believed to share a similar overall tertiary structure? What is the nature of the physical changes linking agonist binding to receptor activation and subsequent transduction of the signal to the associated G protein on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and to other putative signaling pathways? The goal of the present review is to specifically address these questions as well as to depict the current awareness about GPCR structure-function relationships in general.},

The method was designed to accurately compute vibrational modes of partially optimized molecular structures. The key concept was the introduction of several blocks of atoms, which can move as rigid bodies with respect to a local, fully optimized subsystem. The choice of the blocks was restricted in the sense that none of them could be connected, and also linear blocks were not taken into consideration. In this paper an extended version of the MBH method is presented that is generally applicable and allows blocks to be adjoined by one or two common atoms. This extension to all possible block partitions of the molecule provides a structural flexibility varying from very rigid to extremely relaxed. The general MBH method is very well suited to study selected normal modes of large macromolecules (such as proteins and polymers) because the number of degrees of freedom can be greatly reduced while still keeping the essential motions of the molecular system. The reduction in the number of degrees of freedom due to the block linkages is imposed here directly using a constraint method, in contrast to restraint methods where stiff harmonic couplings are introduced to restrain the relative motion of the blocks. The computational cost of this constraint method is less than that of an implementation using a restraint method. This is illustrated for the alpha-helix conformation of an alanine-20-polypeptide.},

The method avoids artificially introduced imaginary frequencies and keeps track of the invariance under global translations and rotations. Only a subblock of the Hessian matrix has to be constructed and diagonalized, leading to a serious reduction of the computational time for the frequency analysis. The mobile block Hessian approach (MBH) proposed in this work can be regarded as an extension of the partial Hessian vibrational analysis approach proposed by Head [Int. J. Quantum Chem. 65, 827 (1997)]. Instead of giving the nonoptimized region of the system an infinite mass, it is allowed to move as a rigid body with respect to the optimized region of the system. The MBH approach is then extended to the case where several parts of the molecule can move as independent multiple rigid blocks in combination with single atoms. The merits of both models are extensively tested on ethanol and di-n-octyl-ether.},

  Abstract                 = {Partial optimization is a useful technique to reduce the computational load in simulations of extended systems. In such nonequilibrium structures, the accurate calculation of localized vibrational modes can be troublesome, since the standard normal mode analysis becomes inappropriate. In a previous paper [A. Ghysels et al., J. Chem. Phys. 126, 224102 (2007)], the mobile block Hessian (MBH) approach was presented to deal with the vibrational analysis in partially optimized systems. In the MBH model, the nonoptimized regions of the system are represented by one or several blocks, which can move as rigid bodies with respect to the atoms of the optimized region. In this way unphysical imaginary frequencies are avoided and the translational/rotational invariance of the potential energy surface is fully respected. In this paper we focus on issues concerning the practical numerical implementation of the MBH model. The MBH normal mode equations are worked out for several coordinate choices. The introduction of a consistent group-theoretical notation facilitates the treatment of both the case of a single block and the case of multiple blocks. Special attention is paid to the formulation in terms of Cartesian variables, in order to provide a link with the standard output of common molecular modeling programs.},

  Abstract                 = {Standard normal mode analysis becomes problematic for complex molecular systems, as a result of both the high computational cost and the excessive amount of information when the full Hessian matrix is used. Several partial Hessian methods have been proposed in the literature, yielding approximate normal modes. These methods aim at reducing the computational load and/or calculating only the relevant normal modes of interest in a specific application. Each method has its own (dis)advantages and application field but guidelines for the most suitable choice are lacking. We have investigated several partial Hessian methods, including the Partial Hessian Vibrational Analysis (PHVA), the Mobile Block Hessian (MBH), and the Vibrational Subsystem Analysis (VSA). In this article, we focus on the benefits and drawbacks of these methods, in terms of the reproduction of localized modes, collective modes, and the performance in partially optimized structures. We find that the PHVA is suitable for describing localized modes, that the MBH not only reproduces localized and global modes but also serves as an analysis tool of the spectrum, and that the VSA is mostly useful for the reproduction of the low frequency spectrum. These guidelines are illustrated with the reproduction of the localized amine-stretch, the spectrum of quinine and a bis-cinchona derivative, and the low frequency modes of the LAO binding protein.

A significant number (N=34) of these macrocycles are administered orally, revealing that oral bioavailability can be obtained at molecular weights up to and above 1 kDa and polar surface areas ranging towards 250 \AA{}2. Moreover, insight from a group of ?de novo designed? oral macrocycles in clinical studies and understanding of how cyclosporin A and model cyclic hexapeptides cross cell membranes, may unlock wider opportunities in drug discovery. However, the number of oral macrocycles is still low and it remains to be seen if they are outliers, or if macrocycles will open up novel oral druggable space.},

  Abstract                 = {Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) at two energy resolutions (1 and 14 microeV) was employed to study high-frequency cholesterol motion in the liquid ordered phase (lo-phase) of oriented multilayers of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine at three temperatures: T = 20 degrees C, T = 36 degrees C, and T = 50 degrees C. We studied two orientations of the bilayer stack with respect to the incident neutron beam. This and the two energy resolutions for each orientation allowed us to determine the cholesterol dynamics parallel to the normal of the membrane stack and in the plane of the membrane separately at two different time scales in the GHz range. We find a surprisingly high, model-independent motional anisotropy of cholesterol within the bilayer. The data analysis using explicit models of molecular motion suggests a superposition of two motions of cholesterol: an out-of-plane diffusion of the molecule parallel to the bilayer normal combined with a locally confined motion within the bilayer plane. The rather high amplitude of the out-of-plane diffusion observed at higher temperatures (T >/= 36 degrees C) strongly suggests that cholesterol can move between the opposite leaflets of the bilayer while it remains predominantly confined within its host monolayer at lower temperatures (T = 20 degrees C). The locally confined in-plane cholesterol motion is dominated by discrete, large-angle rotational jumps of the steroid body rather than a quasicontinous rotational diffusion by small angle jumps. We observe a significant increase of the rotational jump rate between T = 20 degrees C and T = 36 degrees C, whereas a further temperature increase to T = 50 degrees C leaves this rate essentially unchanged.},

  Abstract                 = {The hydrophobic coupling between membrane-spanning proteins and the lipid bilayer core causes the bilayer thickness to vary locally as proteins and other "defects" are embedded in the bilayer. These bilayer deformations incur an energetic cost that, in principle, could couple membrane proteins to each other, causing them to associate in the plane of the membrane and thereby coupling them functionally. We demonstrate the existence of such bilayer-mediated coupling at the single-molecule level using single-barreled as well as double-barreled gramicidin channels in which two gramicidin subunits are covalently linked by a water-soluble, flexible linker. When a covalently attached pair of gramicidin subunits associates with a second attached pair to form a double-barreled channel, the lifetime of both channels in the assembly increases from hundreds of milliseconds to a hundred seconds--and the conductance of each channel in the side-by-side pair is almost 10\% higher than the conductance of the corresponding single-barreled channels. The double-barreled channels are stabilized some 100,000-fold relative to their single-barreled counterparts. This stabilization arises from: first, the local increase in monomer concentration around a single-barreled channel formed by two covalently linked gramicidins, which increases the rate of double-barreled channel formation; and second, from the increased lifetime of the double-barreled channels. The latter result suggests that the two barrels of the construct associate laterally. The underlying cause for this lateral association most likely is the bilayer deformation energy associated with channel formation. More generally, the results suggest that the mechanical properties of the host bilayer may cause the kinetics of membrane protein conformational transitions to depend on the conformational states of the neighboring proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of synthetic peptide antigens in human prophylaxis still suffers from the very important problem of finding suitable carriers devoid of side effects. A desirable carrier for use in humans would be poorly immunogenic by itself, yet it would enhance the immune response to the peptide antigen. In the study reported herein, we examined the role of polytuftsin (TKPR40), a synthetic polymer of the natural immunomodulator tuftsin, as a carrier for synthetic peptides of HIV derived from the gp41 and gp120 proteins. Chimeric immunogens were constructed by chemical linkage between synthetic peptides of HIV and polytuftsin. These were employed for immunization of mice of different MHC haplotypes, and the humoral and cellular immune responses developed against the peptides were assessed by measuring total IgG, IgG, subclasses, T-cell proliferation, and in vitro cytokine release. A significantly stronger immune response was observed in mice immunized with the peptide-polytuftsin conjugates than in mice receiving the peptide dimers (peptide-peptide). Peptide-polytuftsin conjugates induced IgG2a and IgG2b isotype switching after both primary and secondary immunization. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the amounts of cytokines and the shift in the IgG isotypes. These data suggest that the use of polytuftsin as a carrier may increase the immune response against poorly immunogenic synthetic peptides.},

Phys. 74, 3316 (1981)] potential. Coarse graining of van der Waals potential is achieved by treating molecules as soft uniaxial ellipsoids interacting via a generalized anisotropic Gay-Berne function. The charge distribution is represented by point multipole expansion, including point charge, dipole, and quadrupole moments placed at the center of mass. The Gay-Berne and point multipole potentials are combined in the local reference frame defined by the inertial frame of the all-atom counterpart. The coarse-grained model has been applied to rigid-body molecular dynamics simulations of molecular liquids including benzene and methanol. The computational efficiency is improved by several orders of magnitude, while the results are in reasonable agreement with all-atom models and experimental data. We also discuss the implications of using point multipole for polar molecules capable of hydrogen bonding and the applicability of this model to a broad range of molecular systems including highly charged biopolymers.},

  Abstract                 = {We present here a recent development of a generalized coarse-grained model for use in molecular simulations. In this model, interactions between coarse-grained particles consist of both van der Waals and explicit electrostatic components. As a result, the coarse-grained model offers the transferability that is lacked by most current effective-potential based approaches. The previous center-of-mass framework (P. A. Golubkov and P. Ren, J. Chem. Phys., 2006, 125, 64103) is generalized here to include arbitrary off-center interaction sites for both Gay-Berne and multipoles. The new model has been applied to molecular dynamic simulations of neat methanol liquid. By placing a single point multipole at the oxygen atom rather than at the center of mass of methanol, there is a significant improvement in the ability to capture hydrogen-bonding. The critical issue of transferability of the coarse-grained model is verified on methanol-water mixtures, using parameters derived from neat liquids without any modification. The mixture density and internal energy from coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations show good agreement with experimental measurements, on a par with what has been obtained from more detailed atomic models. By mapping the dynamics trajectory from the coarse-grained simulation into the all-atom counterpart, we are able to investigate atomic-level structure and interaction. Atomic radial distribution functions of neat methanol, neat water and mixtures compare favorably to experimental measurements. Furthermore, hydrogen-bonded 6- and 7-molecule chains of water and methanol observed in the mixture are in agreement with previous atomic simulations.},

Combining molecular mechanical and continuum solvent approaches with an improved technique for solute entropy calculation, we obtained an overall transfer free energy of \~{} -13 kcal/mol-1. This value is in qualitative agreement with free energy changes derived from a potential of mean force calculation and indirect experimental observations. Changes in free energies of solvation and ANCH conformational reorganization are unfavorable while ANCH-DMPC interactions - especially van der Waals - favor insertion. These results are consistent with an enthalpy-driven hydrophobic effect, in accord with earlier calorimetric data on the membrane partition of other amphiphiles. Furthermore, structural and entropic analysis of molecular dynamics (MD)-generated ensembles suggests that conformational selection may play a hitherto unappreciated role in membrane insertion of lipid-modified peptides and proteins. 10.1529/biophysj.108.136481},

  Abstract                 = {The use of free-energy landscapes rationalizes a wide range of aspects of protein behavior by providing a clear illustration of the different states accessible to these molecules, as well as of their populations and pathways of interconversion. The determination of the free-energy landscapes of proteins by computational methods is, however, very challenging as it requires an extensive sampling of their conformational spaces. We describe here a technique to achieve this goal with relatively limited computational resources by incorporating nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) chemical shifts as collective variables in metadynamics simulations. As in this approach the chemical shifts are not used as structural restraints, the resulting free-energy landscapes correspond to the force fields used in the simulations. We illustrate this approach in the case of the third Ig-binding domain of protein G from streptococcal bacteria (GB3). Our calculations reveal the existence of a folding intermediate of GB3 with nonnative structural elements. Furthermore, the availability of the free-energy landscape enables the folding mechanism of GB3 to be elucidated by analyzing the conformational ensembles corresponding to the native, intermediate, and unfolded states, as well as the transition states between them. Taken together, these results show that, by incorporating experimental data as collective variables in metadynamics simulations, it is possible to enhance the sampling efficiency by two or more orders of magnitude with respect to standard molecular dynamics simulations, and thus to estimate free-energy differences among the different states of a protein with a k(B)T accuracy by generating trajectories of just a few microseconds.},

N-acetyl-LWYIK-amide (LWYIK) represents the naturally-occurring CRAC motif segment in the pretransmembrane region of the gp41 protein of HIV-1, and N-acetyl-IWYIK-amide (IWYIK), an unnatural isomer, is used as a control. Both peptides thin the SOPC bilayer by approximately 3 A, and cause the area/unit cell (peptide+SOPC) to increase by approximately 9 A2 from the area/lipid of SOPC at 30 degrees C (67.0+/-0.9 A2). Model fitting suggests that LWYIK's average position is slightly closer to the bilayer center than IWYIK's, and both peptides are just inside of the phosphate headgroup. Both peptides increase the wide-angle spacing d of SOPC without cholesterol, whereas with 50\% cholesterol LWYIK increases d but IWYIK decreases d. TLC shows that LWYIK is more hydrophobic than IWYIK; this difference persists in peptide/SOPC 1:9 mole ratio mixtures. Both peptides counteract the chain ordering effect of cholesterol to roughly the same degree, and both decrease KC, the bending modulus, thus increasing the SOPC membrane fluidity. Both peptides nucleate crystals of cholesterol, but the LWYIK-induced crystals are weaker and dissolve more easily.},

  annotation = {Emf measurements at 298 K are reported for Wagner-type galvanic cells with flowing liquid junctions in which one half-cell contains an aqueous electrolyte solution and the other contains the same electrolyte in either acetonitrile (AN) + water mixtures or dimethylformamide (DMF) + water mixtures of varying composition. The electrolytes LiCl, NaCl and KCl have been studied in the AN + water system using Ag/AgCl electrodes, while LiCl, NaCl, KCl and NaBr have been studied in the DMF + water system using flowing amalgam electrodes in each half- cell. The data have been combined with standard Gibbs energies of transfer data from the literature and conductance data, much of it reported here for the first time, to obtain solvation potentials for the cells. Transport numbers for these electrolytes are also reported. The results show that DMF displaces water in the cation solvation sheath as the organic content of the mixed solvent increases, whilst AN shows a similar but less marked effect.},

  Abstract                 = {The mechanism of the all-or-none release of the contents of phospholipid vesicles induced by the antimicrobial peptide cecropin A was investigated. A detailed experimental study of the kinetics of dye release showed that the rate of release increases with the ratio of peptide bound per vesicle and, at constant concentration, with the fraction of the anionic lipid phosphatidylglycerol in neutral, phosphatidylcholine membranes. Direct measurement of the kinetics of peptide binding and dissociation from vesicles revealed that the on-rate is almost independent of vesicle composition, whereas the off-rate decreases by orders of magnitude with increasing content of anionic lipid. A simple, exact model fits all experimental kinetic data quantitatively. This is the first time that an exact kinetic model is implemented for a peptide with an all-or-none mechanism. In this model, cecropin A binds reversibly to vesicles, which at a certain point enter an unstable state. In this state, a pore probably opens and all vesicle contents are released, consistent with the all-or-none mechanism. This pore state is a state of the whole vesicle, but does not necessarily involve all peptides on that vesicle. No peptide oligomerization on the vesicle is involved; alternative models that assume oligomerization are inconsistent with the experimental data. Thus, formation of well-defined, peptide-lined pores is unlikely.},

  abstract             = {The all-or-none kinetic model that we recently proposed for the antimicrobial peptide cecropin A is tested here for magainin 2. In mixtures of phosphatidylcholine (PC)/phosphatidylglycerol (PG) 50:50 and 70:30, release of contents from lipid vesicles occurs in an all-or-none fashion and the differences between PC/PG 50:50 and 70:30 can be ascribed mainly to differences in binding, which was determined independently and is 20 times greater to PC/PG 50:50 than to 70:30. Only one variable parameter, , corresponding to the ratio of the rates of pore opening to pore closing, is used to fit dye release kinetics from these two mixtures, for several peptide/lipid ratios ranging from 1:25 to 1:200. However, unlike for cecropin A where it stays almost constant, increases five times as the PG content of the vesicles increases from 30 to 50\%. Thus, magainin 2 is more sensitive to anionic lipid content than cecropin A. But overall, magainin follows the same all-or-none kinetic model as cecropin A in these lipid mixtures, with slightly different parameter values. When the PG content is reduced to 20 mol \%, dye release becomes very low; the mechanism appears to change, and is consistent with a graded kinetic model. We suggest that the peptide may be inducing formation of PG domains. In either mechanism, no peptide oligomerization occurs and magainin catalyzes dye release in proportion to its concentration on the membrane in a peptide state that we call a pore. We envision this structure as a chaotic orstochastic type of pore, involving both lipids and peptides, not a well-defined, peptide-lined channel.},

Furthermore, resistance development and fungistatic rather than fungicidal activities represent limitations of current antifungal therapy. Therefore there remains an urgent need for a new generation of antifungal agents. According to a polypharmacological approach, the present work concerns the synthesis and antifungal activity of a set of peptides designed to simultaneously target the fungal cell surface and lanosterol demethylase, a key enzyme involved in ergosterol synthesis. Our peptides include amino acid sequences characteristic of membrane-active antimicrobial peptides (AMP), and due to the presence of His residues, they carry the imidazole ring characteristic of azole compounds. The peptides synthesized by us, were tested against different yeast species, and displayed general antifungal activity, with a therapeutically promising antifungal specificity against Cryptococcus neoformans.},

Several electrochemical methods such as polarography or potentiometry in combination with extrathermodynamic assumptions, e.g. the assumption of a reference redox system, the assumption of a negligible liquid junction potential or the assumption of a negligible thermal diffusion potential permit the estimation of single-ion transfer properties. These data are a basis for the understanding of the interactions of ions with solvents and solvent mixtures. Gibbs energies of transfer may be used to learn about the nature of the chemical bond between ions and solvent molecules and to quantize the donor and the acceptor properties of solvents. Entropies of transfer (T Delta(t)S(0)- values) yield information of the effects of the solvated ions on the surrounding solvent matrix. The contributions from the Gibbs energies and the T Delta(t)S(0)-values allow to perceive the enthalpies of transfer.

Previous simulations using this potential demonstrated that anions are more favorably solvated in water than cations. The present work is an attempt to explain this result by examining the effects of ions on the surrounding water structure, with particular focus on the first solvation shell and its interactions with the surrounding water. We conclude that while the first solvation shell surrounding cations is frustrated by competition between ion-water and water-water interactions, solvation of anions is compatible with good water-water interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Rhodopsin, the G protein-coupled receptor primarily responsible for sensing light, is found in an environment rich in polyunsaturated lipid chains and cholesterol. Biophysical experiments have shown that lipid unsaturation and cholesterol both have significant effects on rhodopsin's stability and function; omega-3 polyunsaturated chains, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), destabilize rhodopsin and enhance the kinetics of the photocycle, whereas cholesterol has the opposite effect. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the possibility that polyunsaturated chains modulate rhodopsin stability and kinetics via specific direct interactions. By analyzing the results of 26 independent 100-ns simulations of dark-adapted rhodopsin, we found that DHA routinely forms tight associations with the protein in a small number of specific locations qualitatively different from the nonspecific interactions made by saturated chains and cholesterol. Furthermore, the presence of tightly packed DHA molecules tends to weaken the interhelical packing. These results are consistent with recent NMR work, which proposes that rhodopsin binds DHA, and they suggest a molecular rationale for DHA's effects on rhodopsin stability and kinetics.},

By examining principal components and cluster populations, we show that rhodopsin's fluctuations are not well described by 100 ns of dynamics, and that the sampling is not fully converged even for individual loops.

We confirm with (1)H magic angle spinning NMR that the increased hydration is specific to the metarhodopsin-I intermediate. The internal water molecules interact with several conserved residues, suggesting that changes in internal hydration may be important during the activation of other GPCRs. The results serve to illustrate the synergism of long-time-scale molecular dynamics simulations and NMR in enhancing our understanding of GPCR function.},

The present work attempts to resolve this difficulty using molecular dynamics simulations with the AMOEBA polarizable force field and perturbation techniques to directly compute absolute solvation free energies for potassium, sodium, and chloride ions in liquid water and formamide. Corresponding calculations are also performed with two widely used nonpolarizable force fields. The simulations with the polarizable force field accurately reproduce in vacuo quantum mechanical results, experimental ion-cluster solvation enthalpies, and experimental solvation free energies for whole salts, while the other force fields do not. The results indicate that calculations with a polarizable force field can capture the thermodynamics of ion solvation and that the solvation free energies of the individual ions differ by several kilocalories from commonly cited values.},

The present work contains a series of molecular dynamics simulations designed to provide insight into this phenomenon. Specifically, we performed conventional unbiased simulations, as well as biased molecular dynamics of indole and N-methylindole within palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayers. The unbiased calculations examined the behavior of the indoles in three environments-the membrane center, the headgroup region, and the water outside the membrane. The biased calculations were performed using a new dynamic windowing procedure, which efficiently moved the indoles through the bilayer. These calculations allowed us to explore the orientation, hydrogen bonding, and energetics of the indole, as a function of its location along the membrane normal. Furthermore, free energy profiles were constructed from the biased simulations, facilitating comparison to experiment and a possible explanation of indole's partitioning behavior.}

  Abstract                 = {An implicit solvent model (ISM) for use in molecular mechanics, Monte Carlo, and molecular dynamics simulations on proteins and nucleic acids is proposed that is based on describing the electrostatic component with a screened Coulomb potential (SCP). The SCP has been extended so that both the electrostatic interaction energies and the self-energy terms are included in the solvation energy where the latter has been calculated from the integral Born equation. Ln addition, the SCP is generalized to allow an accounting of the positional dependence of the interactions between charges in a dielectric. To test the potential of the method to provide a reliable and fast implicit description of solvent, a parameter set has been determined to calculate hydration free energies of a group of small-molecule analogs for neutral amino acid residues. Comparison of the calculated with experimental hydration energies of 18 molecules yields a correlation greater than 0.99, demonstrating the feasibility of the method to form the basis of an ISM. A parameter set based solely on hydration energies is not sufficient to account for the considerably different physical conditions found for a solute in the protein "solvent." Methods are explored for further generalizing the parameters to account for macromolecular structure, and it is shown that it may be possible to find a positional function of the coordinates that correlates well with the fraction of each amino acid residue buried in the macromolecule. Such a function would reduce computing time by replacing the need for repetitive calculations of the solvent-accessible surface area (and its derivatives in the case of molecular dynamics simulations) with a simple function of the coordinates.

  abstract =    {Membrane levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), an essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (Ï-3 PUFA), are decreased in common neuropsychiatric disorders. DHA modulates key cell membrane properties like fluidity, thereby affecting the behaviour of transmembrane proteins like G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). These receptors, which have special relevance for major neuropsychiatric disorders have recently been shown to form dimers or higher order oligomers, and evidence suggests that DHA levels affect GPCR function by modulating oligomerisation. In this study, we assessed the effect of membrane DHA content on the formation of a class of protein complexes with particular relevance for brain disease: adenosine A2A and dopamine D2 receptor oligomers. Using extensive multiscale computer modelling, we find a marked propensity of DHA for interaction with both A2A and D2 receptors, which leads to an increased rate of receptor oligomerisation. Bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) experiments performed on living cells suggest that this DHA effect on the oligomerisation of A2A and D2 receptors is purely kinetic. This work reveals for the first time that membrane Ï-3 PUFAs play a key role in GPCR oligomerisation kinetics, which may have important implications for neuropsychiatric conditions like schizophrenia or Parkinson's disease.},

We have mapped the homodimer interface in the dopamine D2 receptor over the entire length of the fourth transmembrane segment (TM4) by crosslinking of substituted cysteines. Their susceptibilities to crosslinking are differentially altered by the presence of agonists and inverse agonists. The TM4 dimer interface in the inverse agonist-bound conformation is consistent with the dimer of the inactive form of rhodopsin modeled with constraints from atomic force microscopy. Crosslinking of a different set of cysteines in TM4 was slowed by inverse agonists and accelerated in the presence of agonists; crosslinking of the latter set locks the receptor in an active state. Thus, a conformational change at the TM4 dimer interface is part of the receptor activation mechanism.},

To clarify how the asymmetry can affect membrane electrostatics, we have performed extensive atomic-scale molecular dynamics simulations of asymmetric lipid membranes composed of zwitterionic (phosphatidylcholine (PC) or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)) and anionic (phosphatidylserine (PS)) leaflets. It turns out that the asymmetry in transmembrane distribution of anionic lipids gives rise to a nonzero potential difference between the two sides of the membrane. This potential arises from the difference in surface charges of the two leaflets. The magnitude of the intrinsic membrane potential was found to be 238 mV and 198 mV for PS/PC and PS/PE membranes, respectively. Remarkably, this potential is of the same sign as the membrane potential in cells. Our findings, being in reasonable agreement with available experimental data, lend support to the idea that the transmembrane lipid asymmetry typical of most living cells contributes to the membrane potential.},

The model of the human receptor of cholecystokinin associated to agonist ligand CCK9 was obtained from a synergistic procedure combining site-directed mutagenesis experiments and in silico modeling. The 31-ns molecular-dynamics simulation in an explicit membrane environment indicates that both the structure of the receptor and its interactions with the ligand are robust. Whereas the secondary structure of the ÃÂ± -helix bundle is well preserved, the region of the intracellular loops exhibits a significant flexibility likely to be ascribed to the absence of G-protein subunits in the model. New insight into the structural features of the binding pocket is gained, in particular, the interplay of the ligand with both the receptor and internal water molecules. Water-mediated interactions are shown to participate in the binding, hence, suggesting additional site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Accurate free energy calculations on mutated ligands provide differences in the receptor-ligand binding affinity, thus offering a direct, quantitative comparison to experiment. We propose that this detailed consistency-checking procedure be used as a routine refinement step of in vacuo GPCR models, before further investigation and application to structure-based drug design.},

  abstract             = {The CHARMM force field for DMPC lipids was modified in order to improve agreement with experiment for a number of important properties of hydrated lipid bilayer. The modification consists in introduction of a scaling factor 0.83 for 1-4 electrostatic interactions (between atoms separated by three covalent bonds), which provides correct transgauche ratio in the alkane tails, and recalculation of the headgroup charges on the basis of HF/6-311(d,p) ab-initio computations. Both rigid TIP3P and flexible SPC water models were used with the new lipid model, showing similar results. The new model in a 75 ns simulation has shown a correct value of the area per lipid at zero surface tension, as well as good agreement with the experiment for the electron density, structure factor, and order parameters, including those in the headgroup part of lipids. {\copyright} 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We propose an implicit-hydrogen model for saturated and monounsaturated acyl chains, aimed at complementing the all-atom CHARMM27 model for phospholipid headgroups. Torsional potentials and nonbonded parameters were fitted to reproduce experimental data and free energy surfaces of all-atom model systems. Comparative simulations of fluid-phase POPC bilayers were performed using the all-hydrogen force field and the present model. The hybrid model accelerates a typical bilayer simulation by about 50\% while sacrificing a minimal amount of detail with respect to the fully atomistic description. In addition, the united-atom description is energetically compatible with all-atom CHARMM models, making it suitable for simulations of complex membrane systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Normal mode analysis (NMA) has been proven valuable in modeling slow conformational dynamics of biomolecular structures beyond the reach of direct molecular simulations. However, it remains computationally expensive to directly solve normal modes for large biomolecular systems. In this study, we have evaluated the accuracy and efficiency of two approximate NMA protocols-one based on our recently proposed vibrational subsystem analysis (VSA), the other based on the rotation translation block (RTB), in comparison with standard NMA that directly solves a full Hessian matrix. By properly accounting for flexibility within blocks of residues or atoms based on a subsystem-environment partition, VSA-based NMA has attained a much higher accuracy than RTB and much lower computing cost than standard NMA. Therefore, VSA enables accurate and efficient calculations of normal modes from all-atom or coarse-grained potential functions, which promise to improve conformational sampling driven by low-frequency normal modes.},

  abstract        = {The parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system regulates the activity of multiple organ systems. Muscarinic receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors that mediate the response to acetylcholine released from parasympathetic nerves. Their role in the unconscious regulation of organ and central nervous system function makes them potential therapeutic targets for a broad spectrum of diseases. The M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2 receptor) is essential for the physiological control of cardiovascular function through activation of G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channels, and is of particular interest because of its extensive pharmacological characterization with both orthosteric and allosteric ligands. Here we report the structure of the antagonist-bound human M2 receptor, the first human acetylcholine receptor to be characterized structurally, to our knowledge. The antagonist 3-quinuclidinyl-benzilate binds in the middle of a long aqueous channel extending approximately two-thirds through the membrane. The orthosteric binding pocket is formed by amino acids that are identical in all five muscarinic receptor subtypes, and shares structural homology with other functionally unrelated acetylcholine binding proteins from different species. A layer of tyrosine residues forms an aromatic cap restricting dissociation of the bound ligand. A binding site for allosteric ligands has been mapped to residues at the entrance to the binding pocket near this aromatic cap. The structure of the M2 receptor provides insights into the challenges of developing subtype-selective ligands for muscarinic receptors and their propensity for allosteric regulation.},

  Abstract                 = {Inward rectifier (Kir) potassium channels are characterized by two transmembrane helices per subunit, plus an intracellular C-terminal domain that controls channel gating in response to changes in concentration of various ligands. Based on the crystal structure of the tetrameric C-terminal domain of Kir3.1, it is possible to build a homology model of the ATP-binding C-terminal domain of Kir6.2. Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to probe the dynamics of Kir C-terminal domains and to explore the relationship between their dynamics and possible mechanisms of channel gating. Multiple simulations, each of 10 ns duration, have been performed for Kir3.1 (crystal structure) and Kir6.2 (homology model), in both their monomeric and tetrameric forms. The Kir6.2 simulations were performed with and without bound ATP. The results of the simulations reveal comparable conformational stability for the crystal structure and the homology model. There is some decrease in conformational flexibility when comparing the monomers with the tetramers, corresponding mainly to the subunit interfaces in the tetramer. The beta-phosphate of ATP interacts with the side chain of K185 in the Kir6.2 model and simulations. The flexibility of the Kir6.2 tetramer is not changed greatly by the presence of bound ATP, other than in two loop regions. Principal components analysis of the simulated dynamics suggests loss of symmetry in both the Kir3.1 and Kir6.2 tetramers, consistent with "dimer-of-dimers" motion of subunits in C-terminal domains of the corresponding Kir channels. This is suggestive of a gating model in which a transition between exact tetrameric symmetry and dimer-of-dimers symmetry is associated with a change in transmembrane helix packing coupled to gating of the channel. Dimer-of-dimers motion of the C-terminal domain tetramer is also supported by coarse-grained (anisotropic network model) calculations. It is of interest that loss of exact rotational symmetry has also been suggested to play a role in gating in the bacterial Kir homolog, KirBac1.1, and in the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor channel.},

  abstract =    {CLC transporters catalyze transmembrane exchange of chloride for protons. Although a putative pathway for Cl(-) has been established, the pathway of H(+) translocation remains obscure. Through a highly concerted computational and experimental approach, we characterize microscopic details essential to understanding H(+)-translocation. An extended (0.4 Âµs) equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation of membrane-embedded, dimeric ClC-ec1, a CLC from Escherichia coli, reveals transient but frequent hydration of the central hydrophobic region by water molecules from the intracellular bulk phase via the interface between the two subunits. We characterize a portal region lined by E202, E203, and A404 as the main gateway for hydration. Supporting this mechanism, site-specific mutagenesis experiments show that ClC-ec1 ion transport rates decrease as the size of the portal residue at position 404 is increased. Beyond the portal, water wires form spontaneously and repeatedly to span the 15-Ã hydrophobic region between the two known H(+) transport sites [E148 (Glu(ex)) and E203 (Glu(in))]. Our finding that the formation of these water wires requires the presence of Cl(-) explains the previously mystifying fact that Cl(-) occupancy correlates with the ability to transport protons. To further validate the idea that these water wires are central to the H(+) transport mechanism, we identified I109 as the residue that exhibits the greatest conformational coupling to water wire formation and experimentally tested the effects of mutating this residue. The results, by providing a detailed microscopic view of the dynamics of water wire formation and confirming the involvement of specific protein residues, offer a mechanism for the coupled transport of H(+) and Cl(-) ions in CLC transporters.},

To further develop a CG protein model for MD simulations, we systematically parametrized the side chains of all 20 naturally occurring amino acids. We developed the parameters by fitting the dihedral potentials of 13 small molecules, the densities and self-solvation free energies of liquids of eight organic molecules, and the hydration free energies of 35 small organic molecules. In a set of 11 classes of compounds (105 in total) including alkanes, alcohols, ethers, ketones/aldehydes, amines, amides, aromatics, carboxylic acids, sulfides/thiols, alkyl ammoniums, and carboxylate ions, the average error in the calculated hydration free energies compared with experimental results is about 1.4 kJ/mol. The average error in the calculated transfer free energies of the 19 side-chain analogues of amino acids from cyclohexane to water is about 2.2 kJ/mol. These results are comparable to the results of all-atom models.},

Direct-acting antimicrobial host-defense peptides can be rapid-acting and potent, and possess an unusually broad spectrum of activity; consequently, they have prospects as new antibiotics, although clinical trials to date have shown efficacy only as topical agents. But for these compounds to fulfill their therapeutic promise and overcome clinical setbacks, further work is needed to understand their mechanisms of action and reduce the potential for unwanted toxicity, to make them more resistant to protease degradation and improve serum half-life, as well as to devise means of manufacturing them on a large scale in a consistent and cost-effective manner. In contrast, the role of cationic host-defense peptides in modulating the innate immune response and boosting infection-resolving immunity while dampening potentially harmful pro-inflammatory (septic) responses gives these peptides the potential to become an entirely new therapeutic approach against bacterial infections.},

  Abstract                 = {The high-resolution three-dimensional structure of an antimicrobial peptide has implications for the mechanism of its antimicrobial activity, as the conformation of the peptide provides insights into the intermolecular interactions that govern the binding to its biological target. For many cationic antimicrobial peptides the negatively charged membranes surrounding the bacterial cell appear to be a main target. In contrast to what has been found for other classes of antimicrobial peptides, solution NMR studies have revealed that in spite of the wide diversity in the amino acid sequences of amphibian antimicrobial peptides (AAMPs), they all adopt amphipathic alpha-helical structures in the presence of membrane-mimetic micelles, bicelles or organic solvent mixtures. In some cases the amphipathic AAMP structures are directly membrane-perturbing (e.g. magainin, aurein and the rana-box peptides), in other instances the peptide spontaneously passes through the membrane and acts on intracellular targets (e.g. buforin). Armed with a high-resolution structure, it is possible to relate the peptide structure to other relevant biophysical and biological data to elucidate a mechanism of action. While many linear AAMPs have significant antimicrobial activity of their own, mixtures of peptides sometimes have vastly improved antibiotic effects. Thus, synergy among antimicrobial peptides is an avenue of research that has recently attracted considerable attention. While synergistic relationships between AAMPs are well described, it is becoming increasingly evident that analyzing the intermolecular interactions between these peptides will be essential for understanding the increased antimicrobial effect. NMR structure determination of hybrid peptides composed of known antimicrobial peptides can shed light on these intricate synergistic relationships. In this work, we present the first NMR solution structure of a hybrid peptide composed of magainin 2 and PGLa bound to SDS and DPC micelles. The hybrid peptide adopts a largely helical conformation and some information regarding the inter-helix organization of this molecule is reported. The solution structure of the micelle associated MG2-PGLa hybrid peptide highlights the importance of examining structural contributions to the synergistic relationships but it also demonstrates the limitations in the resolution of the currently used solution NMR techniques for probing such interactions. Future studies of antimicrobial peptide synergy will likely require stable isotope-labeling strategies, similar to those used in NMR studies of proteins.},

The conformation of peptides and their affinity for phospholipid membranes were evaluated by CD spectroscopy. Patch-clamp experiments revealed that all BXBA-20 peptides form ion channels in DPhPC bilayers exhibiting clearly resolved transitions between the open and closed states. The channel forming frequency was in the order BKBA-20 > BEBA-20 > BSBA-20 > BGBA-20. In the case of BIKBA-20 and BEBA-20, the self- assembled conductive oligomers expressed homogeneous and voltage-independent single channel conductances. In contrast, heterogeneous conductance was observed in BSBA-20 and BGBA-20 ion channels under similar experimental conditions. From these results, we conclude that peptides with a high degree of helical conformation, high amphipathicity, high affinity for lipid membranes, and self-associating characters in vesicles are most suitable for inducing ion channels with a high frequency of occurrence. Moreover, BEBA-20, BSBA-20, and BGBA- 20 channels were cation-selective, whereas the BEBA-20 channel was non-selective.},

  abstract     = {MSMBuilder is a software package for building statistical models of high-dimensional time-series data. It is designed with a particular focus on the analysis of atomistic simulations of biomolecular dynamics such as protein folding and conformational change. MSMBuilder is named for its ability to construct Markov state models (MSMs), a class of models that has gained favor among computational biophysicists. In addition to both well-established and newer MSM methods, the package includes complementary algorithms for understanding time-series data such as hidden Markov models and time-structure based independent component analysis. MSMBuilder boasts an easy to use command-line interface, as well as clear and consistent abstractions through its Python application programming interface. MSMBuilder was developed with careful consideration for compatibility with the broader machine learning community by following the design of scikit-learn. The package is used primarily by practitioners of molecular dynamics, but is just as applicable to other computational or experimental time-series measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {A new implicit solvent model for Monte Carlo simulations of peptides and proteins is presented. The important features of the model are: electrostatics of polar solvation described by nonlinear, distance-dependent screened Coulomb potentials that are formally connected to classical dielectric theory of polar solvation; the self-energy is derived from the integral form of the Born equation; and the introduction of the Born radius of an atom embedded in a protein modeled as a dielectric continuum. The model was parametrized in the context of the CHARMM PAR22 force field by fitting to experimental solvation free energies of amino acid side chain analogues. Introduction of an intrinsic vacuum screening constant for each amino acid was required to obtain the correct screening behavior in solution. Solvation energies of several peptides in different conformations were calculated and compared with the corresponding quantities calculated with the Poisson-Boltzmann equation. The comparative results were highly correlated in all cases, and the correlation was independent of peptide length and charge, Moreover, the self-energy terms and the electrostatic interaction energies, separately calculated from the two methods, were also highly correlated. The computing time required for the model is about 5 times the vacuum calculation for small systems (similar to 100 atoms), but decreases to a factor of 3 as the system size increases. The development of a new hydrogen-bonding algorithm as well as initial results of using the new model for sequence-to-structure calculations on peptides is presented in the accompanying paper. The combination results in a complete continuum solvation model.},

  Abstract                 = {A simple approach for calculating hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) effects in molecular mechanics simulations of peptides and proteins is presented for use in the framework of the continuum solvent model described in the previous paper. In this approach, the solvated macromolecule is treated as a three-component dielectric system consisting of the solvent, bulk protein, and proton acceptor media. The hydrogen bond (H-bond) interaction is identified from the interpenetration of the van der Waals spheres of the polar hydrogen and the proton acceptor. The H-bond geometry is characterized by the ideal orientation of the electron lone pairs in the acceptor atom and the directionality of the proton donor bond, as observed in experimental and ab initio studies, and classified according to the hybridization state of the acceptor atom. The algorithm was implemented into CHARMM using the PAR22 force field. By introducing the concept of a Born radius of a polar hydrogen immersed in an acceptor environment, the stabilization of H-bond energies can be introduced by means of a simple fitting procedure. This H-bonding description is easily implemented in standard force fields, with virtually no additional computing time requirements. Monte Carlo simulations were carried out on two peptides with this H-bonding treatment and the continuum solvent model. The results clearly demonstrate the need for an explicit treatment of H-bonding with the proposed continuum model, and its reliability to predict peptide structures from the primary sequence that are in agreement with experimental results.},

  Abstract                 = {Surfactin is a bacterial lipopeptide with powerful surfactant-like properties. High-sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry was used to study the self association and membrane partitioning of surfactin. The critical micellar concentration (CMC), was 7.5 microM, the heat of micellization was endothermic with DeltaH(w-->m)(Su) = +4.0 kcal/mol, and the free energy of micellization DeltaG(O,w-->m)(Su) = -9.3 kcal/mol (25 degrees C; 100 mM NaCl; 10 mM TRIS, 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.5). The specific heat capacity of micellization was deduced from temperature dependence of DeltaH(w-->m)(Su) as DeltaC(w-->m)(P) = -250 +/- 10 cal/(mol.K). The data can be explained by combining the hydrophobicity of the fatty acyl chain with that of the hydrophobic amino acids. The membrane partition equilibrium was studied using small (30 nm) and large (100 nm) unilamellar POPC vesicles. At 25 degrees C, the partition coefficient, K, was (2.2 +/- 0.2) x 10(4) M(-1) for large vesicles leading to a free energy of DeltaG(O, w-->b)(Su) = -8.3 kcal/mol. The partition enthalpy was again endothermic, with DeltaH(w-->b)(Su) = 9 +/- 1 kcal/mol. The strong preference of surfactin for micelle formation over membrane insertion explains the high membrane-destabilizing activity of the peptide. For surfactin and a variety of non-ionic detergents, the surfactant-to-lipid ratio, inducing membrane solubilization, R(sat)(b), can be predicted by the simple relationship R(sat)(b) approximately K.

  Abstract                 = {Surfactin is a lipopeptide produced by Bacillus subtilis which possesses antimicrobial activity. We have studied the leakage and lysis of POPC vesicles induced by surfactin using calcein fluorescence de-quenching, isothermal titration calorimetry and (31)P solid state NMR. Membrane leakage starts at a surfactin-to-lipid ratio in the membrane, R (b) approximately 0.05, and an aqueous surfactin concentration of C (S) (w) approximately 2 microM. The transient, graded nature of leakage and the apparent coupling with surfactin translocation to the inner leaflet of the vesicles, suggests that this low-concentration effect is due to a bilayer-couple mechanism. Different permeabilization behaviour is found at R (b) approximately 0.15 and attributed to surfactin-rich clusters, which can induce leaks and stabilize them by covering their hydrophobic edges. Membrane lysis or solubilization to micellar structures starts at R (b) (sat) = 0.22 and C (S) (w) = 9 microM and is completed at R (m) (sol) = 0.43 and C (S) (w) = 11 microM. The membrane-water partition coefficient of surfactin is obtained as K = 2 x 10(4) M(-1). These data resolve inconsistencies in the literature and shed light on the variety of effects often referred to as detergent-like effects of antibiotic peptides on membranes. The results are compared with published parameters characterizing the hemolytic and antibacterial activity.},

We have compared the structural effects of surfactin on lipid membranes with those of two nonionic detergents, C12EO6 and C12EO8, by means of solid-state NMR of selectively deuterated lipids. The detergents exhibit the expected behavior of increasing the lateral pressure in the headgroup region and disordering the acyl chains. In contrast, the strong activity of surfactin to destabilize membranes is not reflected in an extreme disordering of the fatty acyl chains. However, surfactin tilts the acyl chains of the lipid and leads to a reorientation of the lipid headgroup toward the membrane interior. These effects provide evidence for a rather deep insertion of the peptide moiety into the hydrophobichydrophilic interface of the membrane. The results are discussed in terms of the molecular parameters governing the activity of a molecule to destabilize lipid membranes and the activity of antibiotic peptides to induce unspecific leakage of membranes.},

  annotation = {The thermodynamics of fluoride ion solvation in nonaqueous and mixed aqueous solvents are reviewed. Gibbs energies of transfer, DELTA(t)G-degrees(F-)H2O --> S, indicate that the solvation of the fluoride ion is dominated by hydrogen bonding. Thus, DELTA(t)G-degrees(F-)H2O --> S, is unfavourable for virtually all solvents, especially dipolar aprotics, and correlates well with solvent acceptor strength. The corresponding enthalpy and entropy data are few and are of low quality but suggest F- solvation is entropy controlled: the only ion known to be so. In mixed aqueous solvents the values of DELTA(t)G-degrees(F-)H2O --> H2O + S generally increase monotonically with declining water content. However, this results from the fortuitous cancellation of dramatic, but largely opposing, variations in DELTA(t)H-degrees and DELTA(t)S-degrees. The complex changes in these parameters are related to subtle changes in ion-solvent and solvent-solvent interactions. Finally, a relationship between fluoride and hydroxide solvation is proposed.},

  abstract             = {A systematic computational approach to describe the conformational dynamics of biomolecules in reduced dimensionality is presented. The method is based on (i) the decomposition of a high-dimensional molecular dynamics trajectory into a few Ã¢ÂÂsystemÃ¢ÂÂ and (many) Ã¢ÂÂbathÃ¢ÂÂ degrees of freedom and (ii) a Langevin simulation of the resulting model. Employing principal component analysis, the dimension of the system is chosen such that it contains all slow large-amplitude motions of the molecule, while the bath coordinates only account for its high-frequency fluctuations. It is shown that a sufficiently large dimension of the model is essential to ensure a clear time scale separation of system and bath variables, which warrants the validity of the memory-free Langevin equation. Applying methods from nonlinear time series analysis, a practical Langevin algorithm is presented which performs a local estimation of the multidimensional Langevin vector fields describing deterministic drift and stochastic driving. Adopting a 800 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the folding of heptaalanine in explicit water, it is shown that a five-dimensional Langevin model correctly reproduces the structure and conformational dynamics of the system. The virtues and limits of the approach are discussed in some detail.},

Benefits of such an organizational structure are the prospects of establishing several target-family-specific experimental techniques and skill sets, thereby enabling a comprehensive functional profiling of drug candidates in different pharmacological respects. In this context, the recently increased number of reports on GPCR ligand-biased signaling has further spurred the efforts in the pharmaceutical industry toward broader biological characterization of the test compounds, for example employing high-content screening to analyze different GPCR ligand-induced signaling pathways. The knowledge of the disease-relevant functional properties of the small molecule GPCR ligands enables target-specific chemical optimization and GPCR-subclass-directed library design. In the case of GPCRs, where little Ã¢ÂÂ although at present slowly expanding Ã¢ÂÂ structural information on the targets is available, the modeling of GPCR structures crucially depends on biological validation (typically supported by site-directed mutagenesis of the GPCR ligand binding site).In this review, we aim to recapitulate efforts in the pharmaceutical industry to address GPCR-directed drug discovery in a target-class-directed platform approach: establishing GPCR-specific biological assay panels and creating computational chemistry methods for finding and optimizing small molecules modulating the activity of GPCRs.

  Abstract                 = {Cytochrome c oxidase couples the reduction of dioxygen to proton pumping against an electrochemical gradient. The D-channel, a 25-A-long cavity, provides the principal pathway for the uptake of chemical and pumped protons. A water chain is thought to mediate the relay of protons via a Grotthuss mechanism through the D-channel, but it is interrupted at N139 in all available crystallographic structures. We use free-energy simulations to examine the proton uptake pathway in the wild type and in single-point mutants N139V and N139A, in which redox and pumping activities are compromised. We present a general approach for the calculation of water occupancy in protein cavities and demonstrate that combining efficient sampling algorithms with long simulation times (hundreds of nanoseconds) is required to achieve statistical convergence of equilibrium properties in the protein interior. The relative population of different conformational and hydration states of the D-channel is characterized. Results shed light on the role of N139 in the mechanism of proton uptake and clarify the physical basis for inactive phenotypes. The conformational isomerization of the N139 side chain is shown to act as a gate controlling the formation of a functional water chain or "proton wire." In the closed state of N139, the spatial distribution of water in the D-channel is consistent with available crystallographic models. However, a metastable state of N139 opens up a narrow bottleneck in which 50\% occupancy by a water molecule establishes a proton pathway throughout the D-channel. Results for N139V suggest that blockage of proton uptake resulting from persistent interruption of the water pathway is the cause of this mutant's marginal oxidase activity. In contrast, results for N139A indicate that the D-channel is a continuously hydrated cavity, implying that the decoupling of oxidase activity from proton pumping measured in this mutant is not due to interruption of the proton relay chain.},

  abstract        = {Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a pathological condition associated with blindness due to progressive retinal degeneration. RP-linked mutations lead to changes at the retinal binding pocket and in the absorption spectra. Here, we evaluate the geometries, electronic effects, and vertical excitation energies in the dark state of mutated human rhodopsins carrying the abnormal substitutions M207R or S186W at the retinal binding pocket. Two models are used, the solvated protein and the protein in a solvated POPC lipid bilayer. We apply homology modeling, classical molecular dynamics simulations, density functional theory (DFT), and quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods. Our results for the wild type bovine and human rhodopsins, used as a reference, are in good agreement with experiment. For the mutants, we find less twisted QM/MM ground-state chromophore geometries around the C(11)-C(12) double bond and substantial blue shifts in the lowest vertical DFT excitation energies. An analysis of the QM energies shows that the chromophore-counterion region is less stable in the mutants compared to the wild type, consistent with recent protein folding studies. The influence of the mutations near the chromophore is discussed in detail to gain more insight into the properties of these mutants. The spectral tuning is mainly associated with counterion effects and structural features of the retinal chain in the case of the hM207R mutant, and with the presence of a neutral chromophore with deprotonated Lys296 in the case of the hS186W mutant.},

  Abstract                 = {A series of antipeptide antibodies designed to recognize specific sequences of the gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) were developed and characterized immunochemically and immunohistologically. These antibodies bound to gap junctions and, on Western blots, to 43-kDa (often resolved as a doublet) and 41-kDa proteins in samples from heart, leptomeningeal cells, and brain. Relatively little of the 41-kDa protein was detectable in heart homogenates. Cultured rat leptomeningeal cells expressed high levels of the gap junction protein Cx43 and were used to analyze its turnover and phosphorylation. Pulse-chase experiments in leptomeningeal cells with [(35)S]methionine indicated that the 41-kDa form of connexin 43 was the first immunoprecipitable translation product. Radiolabel subsequently appeared in the lower band of the doublet at 43 kDa, followed by a shift into the higher band and turnover of the protein with a t(1/2) of 2.7 h. Pulse-chase labeling with [(32)P]P(i) indicated that phosphorylation of connexin 43 was limited to the 43-kDa protein, with a t(1/2) of 1.7 h. Treatment with alkaline phosphatase shifted the apparent molecular mass of the 43-kDa protein doublet such that it comigrated with the 41-kDa form. Hence, the 43-kDa protein observed on Western blots of both leptomeningeal cells and heart arises by phosphorylation of the 41 kDa precursor. Phosphorylation of serine residues accounts for most, if not all, of Cx43 phosphorylation in this system.},

  Abstract                 = {Accumulating evidence suggests that macrophages function as major effector cells in the pathological process of various human diseases. We examined here the role of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) and caspases in the regulation of activation and apoptosis of macrophages. Activation of the human monoblastic leukaemia cell line, U937, by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) increased the expression of CD14/CD86, and cytokine production. PMA stimulation also increased the expression of both pro-caspase-8 and pro-caspase-3 in U937, but not apoptosis or intracellular caspase-3 activity. PMA also increased the expression of X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) in U937, suggesting an inhibitory action for XIAP on the caspase cascade in PMA-stimulated U937. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) showed a significant increase of nuclear NF-kappaB activity in PMA-stimulated U937. When a potent NF-kappaB inhibitor, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), was added to U937 cell culture in the presence of PMA, apoptosis was triggered by activation of caspase-3, which was induced by caspase-8 activation. XIAP expression was markedly suppressed in PMA-treated U937 in the presence of PDTC. The inhibitors of caspase-8 and caspase-3 mostly inhibited apoptosis of U937 treated with PMA in the presence of PDTC. Furthermore, a phenotype of U937 treated with PMA and PDTC in the presence of caspase inhibitor was almost identical to that of unstimulated U937. Our results suggest that the signalling pathways involved in the activation and apoptosis of human macrophages could be co-operatively regulated by the use of NF-kappaB and caspase inhibitors, thus enabling the control of macrophage function and number.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Activation of mast cells and basophils through allergen stimulation releases chemical mediators and synthesizes cytokines. Among these cytokines, IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5 have major roles in allergic inflammation. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the potency of flavonoids (astragalin, fisetin, kaempferol, myricetin, quercetin, and rutin) for the inhibition of cytokine expression and synthesis by human basophils. METHODS: The inhibitory effect of flavonoids on cytokine expression by stimulated KU812 cells, a human basophilic cell line, and freshly purified peripheral blood basophils was measured by means of semiquantitative RT-PCR and ELISA assays. The effects of flavonoids on transcriptional activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells were assessed by means of electrophoretic mobility shift assays. RESULTS: Fisetin suppressed the induction of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5 mRNA expression by A23187-stimulated KU812 cells and basophils in response to cross-linkage of the IgE receptor. Fisetin reduced IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5 synthesis (inhibitory concentration of 50\% [IC(50)] = 19.4, 17.7, and 17.4 micromol/L, respectively) but not IL-6 and IL-8 production by KU812 cells. In addition, fisetin inhibited IL-4 and IL-13 synthesis by anti-IgE antibody-stimulated human basophils (IC(50) = 5.1 and 6.2 micromol/L, respectively) and IL-4 synthesis by allergen-stimulated basophils from allergic patients (IC(50) = 4.8 micromol/L). Among the flavonoids examined, kaempferol and quercetin showed substantial inhibitory activities in cytokine expression but less so than those of fisetin. Fisetin inhibited nuclear localization of nuclear factor of activated T cells c2 by A23187-stimulated KU812 cells. CONCLUSION: These results provide evidence of a novel activity of the flavonoid fisetin that suppresses the expression of T(H)2-type cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-5) by basophils.},

  abstract    = {Allostery is a biological phenomenon of fundamental importance in regulation and signaling, and efforts to understand this process have led to the development of numerous models. In spite of individual successes in understanding the structural determinants of allostery in well-documented systems, much less success has been achieved in identifying a set of quantitative and transferable ground rules that provide an understanding of how allostery works. Are there organizing principles that allow us to relate structurally different proteins, or are the determinants of allostery unique to each system? Using an ensemble-based model, we show that allosteric phenomena can be formulated in terms of conformational free energies of the cooperative elements in a protein and the coupling interactions between them. Interestingly, the resulting allosteric ground rules provide a framework to reconcile observations that challenge purely structural models of site-to-site coupling, including (a) allostery in the absence of pathways of structural distortions, (b) allostery in the absence of any structural change, and (c) the ability of allosteric ligands to act as agonists under some circumstances and antagonists under others. The ensemble view of allostery that emerges provides insights into the energetic prerequisites of site-to-site coupling and thus into how allostery works.},

  Abstract                 = {The reason for the enormous lipid variety present in eukaryotic membranes remains largely an enigma. We suggest that its role is to provide an on-off switch for a signaling event at the membrane level. This is achieved through lipid-lipid interactions that convert membrane protein binding and association events into very cooperative processes while maintaining reversibility. We have previously shown [Hinderliter, A., at al. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 4181-4191] that thermodynamic linkage between an intrinsic tendency for lipid demixing and a preferential interaction of a protein with a specific lipid within the mixture leads to dramatic changes in lipid and protein domain formation. Here, we tested the hypothesis that small alterations in lipid chemical structure alter the magnitude of the net interaction free energy (omega(AB)) between unlike lipids in a predictable manner, and that even very small changes in omega(AB) lead to dramatic changes in bilayer organization when coupled with protein binding. We systematically varied the chemical structure of phosphatidylcholine (PC), in mixtures with a fixed phosphatidylserine (PS), by changing the PC acyl chain length and the degree of unsaturation, and examined domain formation upon addition of a peripheral protein, the synaptotagmin I C2A motif. Experimental excimer/monomer ratios (E/M) of pyrene-substituted lipids mimicking the PS were interpreted using Monte Carlo computer simulations. E/M is larger if the PC melting temperature is lower, suggesting that domain formation is a thermodynamic consequence of weak interactions between PC and PS. Consistent with our hypothesis, only very small changes in omega(AB) were required for prediction of large changes in lipid and protein domain formation.},

  Abstract                 = {The identification of dynamical domains in proteins and the description of the low-frequency domain motions are one of the important applications of numerical simulation techniques. The application of these techniques to large proteins requires a substantial computational effort and therefore cannot be performed routinely, if at all. This article shows how physically motivated approximations permit the calculation of low-frequency normal modes in a few minutes on standard desktop computers. The technique is based on the observation that the low-frequency modes, which describe domain motions, are independent of force field details and can be obtained with simplified mechanical models. These models also provide a useful measure for rigidity in proteins, allowing the identification of quasi-rigid domains. The methods are validated by application to three well-studied proteins, crambin, lysozyme, and ATCase. In addition to being useful techniques for studying domain motions, the success of the approximations provides new insight into the relevance of normal mode calculations and the nature of the potential energy surface of proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {MOTIVATION: In the study of the structural flexibility of proteins, crystallographic Debye-Waller factors are the most important experimental information used in the calibration and validation of computational models, such as the very successful elastic network models (ENMs). However, these models are applied to single protein molecules, whereas the experiments are performed on crystals. Moreover, the energy scale in standard ENMs is undefined and must be obtained by fitting to the same data that the ENM is trying to predict, reducing the predictive power of the model. RESULTS: We develop an elastic network model for the whole protein crystal in order to study the influence of crystal packing and lattice vibrations on the thermal fluctuations of the atom positions. We use experimental values for the compressibility of the crystal to establish the energy scale of our model. We predict the elastic constants of the crystal and compare with experimental data. Our main findings are (1) crystal packing modifies the atomic fluctuations considerably and (2) thermal fluctuations are not the dominant contribution to crystallographic Debye-Waller factors.

  Abstract                 = {We present a new approach for determining dynamical domains in large proteins, either based on a comparison of different experimental structures, or on a simplified normal mode calculation for a single conformation. In a first step, a deformation measure is evaluated for all residues in the protein; a high deformation indicates highly flexible interdomain regions. The sufficiently rigid parts of the protein are then classified into rigid domains and low-deformation interdomain regions on the basis of their global motion. We demonstrate the techniques on three proteins: citrate synthase, which has been the subject of earlier domain analyses, HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, which has a rather complex domain structure, and aspartate transcarbamylase as an example of a very large protein. These examples show that the comparison of conformations and the normal mode analysis lead to essentially the same domain identification, except for cases where the experimental conformations differ by the presence of a large ligand, such as a DNA strand. Normal mode analysis has the advantage of requiring only one experimental structure and of providing a more detailed picture of domain movements, e.g. the splitting of domains into subdomains at higher frequencies.},

A bimane probe was covalently attached to a cysteine residue in a series of single-cysteine mutant proteins to scan each helix in a residue-by-residue fashion. A variety of fluorescence properties of the bimane fluorophore were measured for both the soluble and membrane-bound states of the channel peptide, including the fluorescence emission maximum, fluorescence anisotropy, and membrane bilayer penetration depth. The fluorescence properties were collated for construction of a membrane-bound topology model of helices 4 and 5 of the channel domain. Finally, the data reveal that both helices 4 and 5 are two separate amphipathic ÃÂ±-helices that are situated parallel to the membrane surface. Dual fluorescence quencher analysis shows that helix 4 adopts a tilted topology in which its C-terminus is more buried than its N-terminus within the bilayer. In contrast, helix 5 is relatively solvent-exposed and located parallel to the interfacial region of the membrane surface. However, the loop region of both helices 4 and 5 was shown to be relatively buried within the bilayer. In addition, a least-squares fit of the data to a harmonic wave function indicated that both periodicity and frequency are typical for an amphipathic ÃÂ±-helix (3.75 ÃÂ± 0.1 residues per turn for helix 4 and 3.70 ÃÂ± 0.1 residues per turn for helix 5). Squared residual plots of the harmonic wave function also reveal that the N-terminus of helix 4 is elongated by two residues from Lys-406 to Phe-404, while the C-terminus of helix 5 is elongated by three residues from Tyr-434 to Ile-437 upon membrane association.},

  abstract             = {Abstract: The transient changes of the tryptophan fluorescence of bovine rhodopsin in ROS membranes were followed in time from 1 ÃÂ¼s to 10 s after flash excitation of the photoreceptor. Up to about 100 ÃÂ¼s the fluorescence did not change, suggesting that the tryptophan lifetimes in rhodopsin and the MI intermediate are similar. The fluorescence then decreases on the millisecond time scale with kinetics that match the rise of the MII state as measured on the same sample by the transient absorption increase at 360 nm. Both the sign and kinetics of the fluorescence change strongly suggest that it is due to an increase in energy transfer to the retinylidene chromophore caused by the increased spectral overlap in MII. Calculation of the Forster radius of each tryptophan from the high-resolution crystal structure suggests that W265 and W126 are already completely quenched in the dark, whereas W161, W175, and W35 are located at distances from the retinal chromophore that are comparable to their Forster radii. The fluorescence from these residues is thus sensitive to an increase in energy transfer in MII. Similar results were obtained at other temperatures and with monomeric rhodopsin in dodecyl maltoside micelles. A large light-induced transient fluorescence increase was observed with ROS membranes that were selectively labeled with Alexa594 at cysteine 316 in helix 8. Using transient absorption spectroscopy the kinetics of this structural change at the cytoplasmic surface was compared to the formation of the signaling state MII (360 nm) and to the kinetics of proton uptake as measured with the pH indicator dye bromocresol purple (605 nm). The fluorescence kinetics lags behind the deprotonation of the Schiff base. The proton uptake is even further delayed. These observations show that in ROS membranes (at pH 6) the sequence of events is Schiff base deprotonation, structural change, and proton uptake. From the temperature dependence of the kinetics we conclude that the Schiff base deprotonation and the transient fluorescence have comparable activation energies, whereas that of proton uptake is much smaller.},

The dianion of p-nitrophenyl phosphate reacts 7500- and 8750- fold faster in these solvents, respectively, than the corresponding aqueous reactions. The monoanion reacts 14- and 16-fold slower respectively in tert-butyl alcohol and in tert- amyl alcohol. Analysis of the activation parameters shows that the rate enhancement for the dianion is due solely to entropic factors, while the slower reaction of the monoanion is due to increased enthalpy of activation. The significantly more positive entropy of activation for the solvolysis of p- nitrophenyl phosphate dianion in tert-butyl alcohol supports the original proposal that racemization at phosphorus in this reaction is caused by a switch to a D-N + A(N) mechanism, rather than subsequently proposed mechanisms which avoid the formation of metaphosphate. Rate enhancements of similar magnitudes are seen for the dianion reactions of all of the aryl phosphates examined; the slope of a plot of the rate constants for solvolysis versus the aqueous pK(a) of the leaving phenols has a slope of -1.1, within experimental error of the value for the aqueous reaction. However, in the reactions in tert-amyl alcohol, para-substituted and meta- substituted aryl phosphates fall on separate but parallel lines with para-substituted compounds reacting faster than meta- substituted reactants with leaving groups of similar pK(a). The pK(a) values for a series of para- and meta-substituted phenols in tert-butyl alcohol and in tert-amyl alcohol were determined and were found to have a linear relationship with the aqueous pK(a) values, with no distinction between para and meta substitution. Thus the different BrOnsted behavior of para- and meta-substituted aryl phosphates in these solvents is not due to differential solvent-induced perturbations of the pK(a) values of the leaving groups. The mechanistic implications of these results and their relevance to enzymatic phosphoryl transfer are discussed.},

the lipid bilayers of fungal membranes, causing curvature-induced strain and eventual permeabilization. One class of these,

pharmaceutical. Understanding the mechanism by which fengycins damage lipid bilayers could prove useful to the future
development of related antifungal treatments. In this work, we present multi-microsecond-long simulations of fengycin interacting
with different lipid bilayer systems. We see fengycin aggregation and uncover a clear aggregation pattern that is partially
influenced by bilayer composition. We also quantify some local bilayer perturbations caused by fengycin binding, including curvature

Recently, we used all-atom simulations to demonstrate that different lipid species have preferential interactions and possible binding sites on rhodopsin's surface, consistent with experiment. However, the limited timescales of the simulations meant that the statistical uncertainty of these results was substantial. Accordingly, we present here 32 independent 1.6 Î¼s coarse-grained simulations exploring lipids and cholesterols surrounding rhodopsin and opsin, in lipid bilayers mimicking those found naturally. Our results agree with those found experimentally and in previous simulations, but with far better statistical certainty. The results demonstrate the value of combining all-atom and coarse-grained models with experiment to provide a well-rounded view of lipid-protein interactions.},

Our simulations suggest that these lipopeptides prefer to aggregate in solution and alter the intrinsic order of the lipid bilayer upon binding.

  Abstract                 = {The prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens is a major medical concern, prompting increased interest in the development of novel antimicrobial compounds. One such set of naturally occurring compounds, known as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), have broad-spectrum activity, but come with many limitations for clinical use. Recent work has resulted in a set of antimicrobial lipopeptides (AMLPs) with micromolar minimum inhibitory concentrations and excellent selectivity for bacterial membranes. To characterize a potent, synthetic lipopeptide, C16-KGGK, we used multi-microsecond coarse-grained simulations with the MARTINI forcefield, with a total simulation time of nearly 46Î¼s. These simulations show rapid binding of C16-KGGK, which forms micelles in solution, to model bacterial lipid bilayers. Furthermore, upon binding to the surface of the bilayer, these lipopeptides alter the local lipid organization by recruiting negatively charged POPG lipids to the site of binding. It is likely that this drastic reorganization of the bilayer has major effects on bilayer dynamics and cellular processes that depend on specific bilayer compositions. By contrast, the simulations revealed no association between the lipopeptides and model mammalian bilayers. These simulations provide biophysical insights into lipopeptide selectivity and suggest a possible mechanism for antimicrobial action.

Since the timescale for the formation of the metarhodopsin II intermediate (>1 ms) is beyond that readily accessible by molecular dynamics, we use NMR distance restraints derived from 13C dipolar recoupling measurements to guide the simulations. The simulations yield a working model for how photoisomerization of the 11-cis retinylidene chromophore bound within the interior of rhodopsin is coupled to transmembrane helix motion and receptor activation. The mechanism of activation that emerges is that multiple switches on the extracellular (or intradiscal) side of rhodopsin trigger structural changes that converge to disrupt the ionic lock between helices H3 and H6 on the intracellular side of the receptor.},

  Abstract                 = {Knowing the partitioning free energy of unfolded polypeptides into membrane interfaces is necessary for understanding membrane protein stability and for designing antimicrobial and other peptides. Experiment-based whole-residue free-energy (hydropathy) scales for amino acids in unfolded peptides, derived from the partitioning of host-guest pentapeptides (Ac-WLXLL) into the interfaces of phosphatidylcholine bilayers and into n-octanol, have been determined by W. C. Wimley, S. H. White, and colleagues [(1996) Nat. Struc. Biol. 3, 842; Wimley, W. C. et al. (1996) Biochemistry 35, 5109]. These scales offer the possibility of computing absolute partitioning free energies of unfolded peptides given only their amino acid sequences. However, the scales are incomplete, because partitioning free energies of N- and C-terminal groups are missing. To complete the scales, we have measured the pH-dependent partitioning of the host-guest pentapeptide variants AcWL-X-LL-NH(2) and WL-X-LL-NH(2) (X = G or W) into palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayer interfaces and n-octanol. These measurements, in combination with the earlier ones, lead to hydrophobicity scale values for protonation, deprotonation, or acetylation of the N terminus and protonation, deprotonation, or amidation of the C terminus. A surprising finding is that a charged N terminus has a much smaller effect on bilayer partitioning than a charged C terminus. We present a simple algorithm for computing the absolute partitioning free energies of unfolded peptides into the phosphatidylcholine bilayer interface.},

  Abstract                 = {To overcome the problem of insufficient conformational sampling within biomolecular simulations, we have developed a novel Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics (H-REMD) scheme that uses soft-core interactions between those parts of the system that contribute most to high energy barriers. The advantage of this approach over other H-REMD schemes is the possibility to use a relatively small number of replicas with locally larger differences between the individual Hamiltonians. Because soft-core potentials are almost the same as regular ones at longer distances, most of the interactions between atoms of perturbed parts will only be slightly changed. Rather, the strong repulsion between atoms that are close in space, which in many cases results in high energy barriers, is weakened within higher replicas of our proposed scheme. In addition to the soft-core interactions, we proposed to include multiple replicas using the same Hamiltonian/level of softness. We have tested the new protocol on the GTP and 8-Br-GTP molecules, which are known to have high energy barriers between the anti and syn conformation of the base with respect to the sugar moiety. During two 25 ns MD simulations of both systems the transition from the more stable to the less stable (but still experimentally observed) conformation is not seen at all. Also temperature REMD over 50 replicas for 1 ns did not show any transition at room temperature. On the other hand, more than 20 of such transitions are observed in H-REMD using six replicas (at three different Hamiltonians) during 6.8 ns per replica for GTP and 12 replicas (at six different Hamiltonians) during 8.7 ns per replica for 8-Br-GTP. The large increase in sampling efficiency was obtained from an optimized H-REMD scheme involving soft-core potentials, with multiple simulations using the same level of softness. The optimization of the scheme was performed by fast mimicking [J. Hritz and C. Oostenbrink, J. Chem. Phys. 127, 204104 (2007)].},

  Abstract                 = {The lipid matrix, or the lipid bilayer, of cell membranes is a natural binding site for amphipathic molecules, including antimicrobial peptides, pore-forming proteins, and many drugs. The unique property of pore-forming antimicrobial peptides is that they exhibit a threshold concentration (called the lethal concentration or the minimum inhibitory concentration) for activity, below which no effect is seen. Without this property, antimicrobial peptides would not be effective self-defense weapons, because they would have harmed all cells at any concentration. The question is what gives rise to this unique property? This study provides a free energy description for the origin of a threshold concentration. The same free energy applied differently also explains the binding of drugs that shows no threshold concentrations. The idea is compared with theories of micellar solutions that require a large oligomer size (n 15) to achieve a threshold concentration. The elasticity of lipid bilayers makes the phenomena in membranes different. The majority of antimicrobial peptides have a large negative binding energy to the bilayer interface, but the binding causes an expansion in the membrane area, or equivalently a thinning in the membrane thickness. This elastic energy of membrane thinning elevates the energy level of interfacial binding with the peptide concentration, hence gives rise to a threshold concentration for forming pores containing as few as four peptides.},

  abstract    = {The lateral heterogeneity of cellular membranes plays an important role in many biological functions such as signaling and regulating membrane proteins. This heterogeneity can result from preferential interactions between membrane components or interactions with membrane proteins. One major difficulty in molecular dynamics simulations aimed at studying the membrane heterogeneity is that lipids diffuse slowly and collectively in bilayers, and therefore, it is difficult to reach equilibrium in lateral organization in bilayer mixtures. Here, we propose the use of the replica exchange with solute tempering (REST) approach to accelerate lateral relaxation in heterogeneous bilayers. REST is based on the replica exchange method but tempers only the solute, leaving the temperature of the solvent fixed. Since the number of replicas in REST scales approximately only with the degrees of freedom in the solute, REST enables us to enhance the configuration sampling of lipid bilayers with fewer replicas, in comparison with the temperature replica exchange molecular dynamics simulation (T-REMD) where the number of replicas scales with the degrees of freedom of the entire system. We apply the REST method to a cholesterol and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC) bilayer mixture and find that the lateral distribution functions of all molecular pair types converge much faster than in the standard MD simulation. The relative diffusion rate between molecules in REST is, on average, an order of magnitude faster than in the standard MD simulation. Although REST was initially proposed to study protein folding and its efficiency in protein folding is still under debate, we find a unique application of REST to accelerate lateral equilibration in mixed lipid membranes and suggest a promising way to probe membrane lateral heterogeneity through molecular dynamics simulation.},

At the same time, the optimization of the inactivation of antimicrobial lipopeptides to spores of B. cereus by a response surface methodology was studied. Results showed that B. cereus had high sensitivity to it, whose minimal inhibitory concentration was 156.25 microg/ml. It could result in the death of spores by destroying the structure of resting spores and sprouting spores, as was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The optimization result indicated that spores of B. cereus could be inactivated by 2 orders of magnitude when the temperature was 29.6 degrees C, the action time was 7.6 h, and the concentration was 3.46 mg.ml(-1).},

  Abstract                 = {Proteins frequently accomplish their biological function by collective atomic motions. Yet the identification of collective motions related to a specific protein function from, e.g., a molecular dynamics trajectory is often non-trivial. Here, we propose a novel technique termed "functional mode analysis" that aims to detect the collective motion that is directly related to a particular protein function. Based on an ensemble of structures, together with an arbitrary "functional quantity" that quantifies the functional state of the protein, the technique detects the collective motion that is maximally correlated to the functional quantity. The functional quantity could, e.g., correspond to a geometric, electrostatic, or chemical observable, or any other variable that is relevant to the function of the protein. In addition, the motion that displays the largest likelihood to induce a substantial change in the functional quantity is estimated from the given protein ensemble. Two different correlation measures are applied: first, the Pearson correlation coefficient that measures linear correlation only; and second, the mutual information that can assess any kind of interdependence. Detecting the maximally correlated motion allows one to derive a model for the functional state in terms of a single collective coordinate. The new approach is illustrated using a number of biomolecules, including a polyalanine-helix, T4 lysozyme, Trp-cage, and leucine-binding protein.},

This review provides examples that illustrate strategies for interpreting the data in terms of specific rearrangements in secondary and tertiary structure. The changes in the mobility and solvent accessibility of the spin label side chains, and in the distances between spin labels, report (i) rigid body motions of alpha-helices and beta-strands (ii) relative movements of domains and (iii) changes in secondary structure. Such events can be monitored in the millisecond time-scale, making it possible to follow structural changes during function. There is no upper limit to the size of proteins that can be investigated, and only 50-100 picomoles of protein are required. These features make site-directed spin labeling an attractive approach for the study of structure and dynamics in a wide range of systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The non-Markovian approach developed in the companion paper [Hughes et al., J. Chem. Phys. 131, 024109 (2009)], which employs a hierarchical series of approximate spectral densities, is extended to the treatment of nonadiabatic dynamics of coupled electronic states. We focus on a spin-boson-type Hamiltonian including a subset of system vibrational modes which are treated without any approximation, while a set of bath modes is transformed to a chain of effective modes and treated in a reduced-dimensional space. Only the first member of the chain is coupled to the electronic subsystem. The chain construction can be truncated at successive orders and is terminated by a Markovian closure acting on the end of the chain. From this Mori-type construction, a hierarchy of approximate spectral densities is obtained which approach the true bath spectral density with increasing accuracy. Applications are presented for the dynamics of a vibronic subsystem comprising a high-frequency mode and interacting with a low-frequency bath. The bath is shown to have a striking effect on the nonadiabatic dynamics, which can be rationalized in the effective-mode picture. A reduced two-dimensional subspace is constructed which accounts for the essential features of the nonadiabatic process induced by the effective environmental mode. Electronic coherence is found to be preserved on the shortest time scale determined by the effective mode, while decoherence sets in on a longer time scale. Numerical simulations are carried out using either an explicit wave function representation of the system and overall bath or else an explicit representation of the system and effective-mode part in conjunction with a Caldeira-Leggett master equation.},

VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more "representations," in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

  abstract             = {Cholesterol, due to its condensing effect, is considered an important regulator of membrane thickness. Other sterols, due to their structural similarities to cholesterol, are often assumed to have a universal effect on membrane properties similar to the condensing effect of cholesterol, albeit possibly to different degrees. We used x-ray diffraction to investigate this assumption. By the combination of lamellar diffraction and grazing-angle scattering, we measured the membrane thickness and the tilt-angle distribution of the lipid's hydrocarbon chains. This method is sensitive to phase separation, which is important for examining the miscibility of sterols and phospholipids. Mixtures of ergosterol or cholesterol with dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine, and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine were systematically studied. We found that mixing ergosterol with phospholipids into a single phase became increasingly difficult with higher sterol concentrations and also with higher concentrations of unsaturated lipid chains. The only condensing effect of ergosterol was found in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine, although the effect was less than one-third of the effect of cholesterol. Unlike cholesterol, ergosterol could not maintain a fixed electron density profile of the surrounding lipids independent of hydration. In dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine, ergosterol made the membranes thinner, opposite to the effect of cholesterol. In all cases, the tilt-angle variation of the chain diffraction was consistent with the membrane thickness changes measured by lamellar diffraction, i.e., a thickening was always associated with a reduction of chain tilt angles. Our findings do not support the notion that different sterols have a universal behavior that differs only in degree.},

The mixed-chain phospholipids contained saturated stearic acid (18:0) in the sn-1 position and the monounsaturated oleic acid (18:1) or polyunsaturated docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) in sn-2. Lateral lipid organization was evaluated by 2H NMR order parameter measurements on stearic acid of all individual types of phospholipids in the mixture and, through a novel approach, two-dimensional NOESY 1H NMR spectroscopy with magic angle spinning (MAS). The docosahexaenoic acid chain order was evaluated from 1H NMR chain signal MAS-sideband intensities. Averaged over all lipids, the cholesterol-induced increase in sn-1 chain order is 2-fold larger in monounsaturated than in polyunsaturated lipids, and the order of both saturated and polyunsaturated hydrocarbon chains increases. Addition of cholesterol increases lipid order in the sequence 18:0-18:1 PE > 18:0-18:1 PC > 18:0-18:1 PS for the monounsaturated and 18:0-22:6 PC >> 18:0-22:6 PE > 18:0-22:6 PS for polyunsaturated mixtures. The variation of order parameters between lipid species suggests that cholesterol induces the formation of lipid microdomains with a headgroup and chain unsaturation-dependent lipid composition. The preferential interaction between cholesterol and polyunsaturated 18:0-22:6 PC, followed by 18:0-22:6 PE and 18:0-22:6 PS, was confirmed by 1H MAS NOESY cross-relaxation rate differences. Furthermore, cholesterol preferentially associates with saturated chains in mixed-chain lipids reflected by higher saturated chain-to-cholesterol cross-relaxation rates. We propose that cholesterol forms PC-enriched microdomains in the polyunsaturated 18:0-22:6 PC/18:0-22:6 PE/18:0-22:6 PS/cholesterol membranes in which the saturated sn-1 chains are preferentially oriented toward the cholesterol molecules.},

  Abstract                 = {There is evidence that membranes of rod outer segment (ROS) disks are a high-affinity Ca(2+) binding site. We were interested to see if the high occurrence of sixfold unsaturated docosahexaenoic acid in ROS lipids influences Ca(2+)-membrane interaction. Ca(2+) binding to polyunsaturated model membranes that mimic the lipid composition of ROS was studied by microelectrophoresis and (2)H NMR. Ca(2+) association constants of polyunsaturated membranes were found to be a factor of approximately 2 smaller than constants of monounsaturated membranes. Furthermore, strength of Ca(2+) binding to monounsaturated membranes increased with the addition of cholesterol, while binding to polyunsaturated lipids was unaffected. The data suggest that the lipid phosphate groups of phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylserine (PS) in PC/PE/PS (4:4:1, mol/mol) are primary targets for Ca(2+). Negatively charged serine in PS controls Ca (2+) binding by lowering the electric surface potential and elevating cation concentration at the membrane/water interface. The influence of hydrocarbon chain unsaturation on Ca(2+) binding is secondary compared to membrane PS content. Order parameter analysis of individual lipids in the mixture revealed that Ca(2+) ions did not trigger lateral phase separation of lipid species as long as all lipids remained liquid-crystalline. However, depending on temperature and hydrocarbon chain unsaturation, the lipid with the highest chain melting temperature converted to the gel state, as observed for the monounsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in PC/PE/PS (4:4:1, mol/mol) at 25 degrees C.},

  Abstract                 = {Membrane binding of a doubly lipid modified heptapeptide from the C-terminus of the human N-ras protein was studied by Fourier transform infrared, solid-state NMR, and neutron diffraction spectroscopy. The 16:0 peptide chains insert well into the 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine phospholipid matrix. This is indicated by a common main phase transition temperature of 21.5 degrees C for both the lipid and peptide chains as revealed by FTIR measurements. Further, (2)H NMR reveals that peptide and lipid chains have approximately the same chain length in the liquid crystalline state. This is achieved by a much lower order parameter of the 16:0 peptide chains compared to the 14:0 phospholipid chains. Finally, proton/deuterium contrast variation of neutron diffraction experiments indicates that peptide chains are localized in the membrane interior analogous to the phospholipid chains. In agreement with this model of peptide chain insertion, the peptide part is localized at the lipid-water interface of the membrane. This is revealed by (1)H nuclear Overhauser enhancement spectra recorded under magic angle spinning conditions. Quantitative cross-peak analysis allows the examination of the average location of the peptide backbone and side chains with respect to the membrane. While the backbone shows the strongest cross-relaxation rates with the phospholipid glycerol, the hydrophobic side chains of the peptide insert deeper into the membrane interior. This is supported by neutron diffraction experiments that reveal a peptide distribution in the lipid-water interface of the membrane. Concurring with these experimental findings, the amide protons of the peptide show strong water exchange as seen in NMR and FTIR measurements. No indications for a hydrogen-bonded secondary structure of the peptide backbone are found. Therefore, membrane binding of the C-terminus of the N-ras protein is mainly due to lipid chain insertion but also supported by interactions between hydrophobic side chains and the lipid membrane. The peptide assumes a mobile and disordered conformation in the membrane. Since the C-terminus of the soluble part of the ras protein is also disordered, we hypothesize that our model for membrane binding of the ras peptide realistically describes the membrane binding of the lipidated C-terminus of the active ras protein.},

In our model, each lipid is represented by one "hydrophilic" and three "hydrophobic" beads. The amphiphilic peptide is modeled as a hydrophobic-hydrophilic cylinder with hydrophilic caps. We find that with increasing peptide-lipid attraction the preferred state of the peptide changes from desorbed to adsorbed to inserted. A single peptide with weak attraction binds on the bilayer surface, while one with strong attraction spontaneously inserts into the bilayer. We show how several peptides which individually only bind to the bilayer surface cooperatively insert. Furthermore, hydrophilic strips along the peptide cylinder induce the formation of multi-peptide pores, whose size and morphology depend on the peptides' overall hydrophilicity, the distribution of hydrophilic residues, and the peptide-peptide interactions. Strongly hydrophilic peptides insert less readily, but prove to be more destructive to bilayer integrity. 10.1529/biophysj.108.131300},

However, the mechanism of chiral discrimination on the CSP remained elusive until now. In this study, a spectroscopic investigation of the chiral discrimination mechanism of CSP 1 was undertaken using mixtures of (R)-N-3,5-dinitrobenzoyl phenylglycinol-derived chiral selector (2) and each of the enantiomers of N-acylnaphthylalkylamines (3) by NMR study. First, the differences in free energy changes (DeltaDeltaG) upon diastereomeric complexation in solution between the complex of each isomer with chiral selector 2 by NMR titration were calculated. The values were then compared with those estimated by chiral HPLC. The chemical shift changes of each proton on the chiral selector and analytes were also checked and it was found that the chemical shift changes decreased continuously as the acyl group on analytes increased in length. This observation was consistent with the HPLC data. From these experimental results, the interaction mechanism of chiral discrimination between the chiral selector and the analytes is more precisely explained.},

The quality of the predicted structures, judged by comparison of the root-mean-square deviations of a room temperature ensemble of conformations from the replica-exchange simulations and experimental structures from both solid-state NMR in lipid bilayers and solution-phase NMR on the protein in micelles, was quite good, reinforcing the general quality of the folding simulations. The transmembrane helical segment of the protein was well defined in comparison with experiment and the amphipathic helical fragment remained at the membrane/aqueous phase boundary while undergoing significant conformational flexibility due to the loop connecting the two helical segments of the protein. Additional comparisons of computed solid-state NMR properties, the 15N chemical shift and 15N-1H dipolar coupling constants, showed semi-quantitative agreement with the corresponding measurements. These findings suggest an emerging potential for the de novo investigation of integral membrane peptides and proteins and a mechanism to assist experimental approaches to the characterization and structure determination of these important systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Solid-state NMR (SSNMR) is an invaluable tool for determining orientations of membrane proteins and peptides in lipid bilayers. Such orientational descriptions provide essential information about membrane protein functions. However, when a semi-static single conformer model is used to interpret various SSNMR observables, important dynamics information can be missing, and, sometimes, even orientational information can be misinterpreted. In addition, over the last decade, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and semi-static SSNMR interpretation have shown certain levels of discrepancies in terms of transmembrane helix orientation and dynamics. Dynamic fitting models have recently been proposed to resolve these discrepancies by taking into account transmembrane helix whole body motions using additional parameters. As an alternative approach, we have developed SSNMR ensemble dynamics (SSNMR-ED) using multiple conformer models, which generates an ensemble of structures that satisfies the experimental observables without any fitting parameters. In this review, various computational methods for determining transmembrane helix orientations are discussed, and the distributions of VpuTM (from HIV-1) and WALP23 (a synthetic peptide) orientations from SSNMR-ED simulations are compared with those from MD simulations and semi-static/dynamic fitting models. Such comparisons illustrate that SSNMR-ED can be used as a general means to extract both membrane protein structure and dynamics from the SSNMR measurements.

In this study, the interaction of F5W-magainin 2 (GIGKWLHSAKKFGKAFVGEIMNS), an equipotent analogue of magainin 2 isolated from the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis, with unfixed Bacillus megaterium and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells was investigated, using confocal laser scanning microscopy. A small amount of tetramethylrhodamine-labeled F5W-magainin 2 was incorporated into the unlabeled peptide for imaging. The influx of fluorescent markers of various sizes into the cytosol revealed that magainin 2 permeabilized bacterial and mammalian membranes in significantly different ways. The peptide formed pores with a diameter of [\~{}]2.8 nm (< 6.6 nm) in B. megaterium, and translocated into the cytosol. In contrast, the peptide significantly perturbed the membrane of CHO-K1 cells, permitting the entry of a large molecule (diameter, >23 nm) into the cytosol, accompanied by membrane budding and lipid flip-flop, mainly accumulating in mitochondria and nuclei. Adenosine triphosphate and negatively charged glycosaminoglycans were little involved in the magainin-induced permeabilization of membranes in CHO-K1 cells. Furthermore, the susceptibility of CHO-K1 cells to magainin was found to be similar to that of erythrocytes. Thus, the distinct membrane-permeabilizing processes of magainin 2 in bacterial and mammalian cells were, to the best of our knowledge, visualized and characterized in detail for the first time. 10.1529/biophysj.108.133488},

The Gibbs energies of transfer, DELTA(t)G(THETA), have been determined from solubility product or potentiometric measurements, and the enthalpies of transfer, DELTA(t)H(THETA), have been determined calorimetrically. The entropies of transfer, DELTA(t)S(THETA), have been calculated from the experimentally obtained DELTA(t)G(THETA) and DELTA(t)H(THETA) values. The extrathermodynamic tetraphenylarsonium tetraphenylborate (TATB) assumption has been applied in order to calculate the contribution from the individual ions. Previously determined transfer thermodynamic functions for monovalent ions from water to methanol, acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, pyridine, tetrahydrothiophene and liquid ammonia are summarized and discussed in this paper. The transfer thermodynamic behaviour of the monovalent ions shows that the cations studied can be divided into two groups, metal ions and cations with hydrocarbon groups facing the solvent, and the anions can accordingly be divided into the subgroups inorganic anions and anions with hydrocarbon group(s) facing the solvent. The DELTA(t)G(THETA) and DELTA(t)H(THETA) terms counterbalance each other in such a way that the DELTA(t)S(THETA) terms become almost constant for each of these subgroups of ions in a certain solvent. The hard alkali-metal ions are as strongly solvated by dimethyl sulfoxide as by any other solvent, while the weakest solvation is found in N,N-dimethylthioformamide among the solvents in this study. The soft silver ion is, on the other hand, most strongly solvated in N,N- dimethylthioformamide. The strongest solvation of the thallium(I) ion, which is a borderline acceptor, is found in dimethyl sulfoxide and NN-dimethylthioformamide. The transfer thermodynamics of the ammonium and tetraalkylammonium ions display an irregular pattern with the NH4+ ion behaving as the hard monovalent metal ions and the (C4H9)4N+ ion behaves as the tetraphenylarsonium ion. The inorganic anions are all more strongly solvated in water than in any other solvent, and the DELTA(t)S(THETA) values are pronouncedly negative, while the anions with hydrocarbon groups are more strongly solvated in the non-aqueous solvents and with positive DELTA(t)S(THETA) values.},

  Abstract                 = {Many drugs and other small molecules used to modulate biological function are amphiphiles that adsorb at the bilayer/solution interface and thereby alter lipid bilayer properties. This is important because membrane proteins are energetically coupled to their host bilayer by hydrophobic interactions. Changes in bilayer properties thus alter membrane protein function, which provides an indirect way for amphiphiles to modulate protein function and a possible mechanism for "off-target" drug effects. We have previously developed an electrophysiological assay for detecting changes in lipid bilayer properties using linear gramicidin channels as probes. Gramicidin channels are mini-proteins formed by the transbilayer dimerization of two non-conducting subunits. They are sensitive to changes in their membrane environment, which makes them powerful probes for monitoring changes in lipid bilayer properties as sensed by bilayer spanning proteins. We now demonstrate a fluorescence assay for detecting changes in bilayer properties using the same channels as probes. The assay is based on measuring the time-course of fluorescence quenching from fluorophore-loaded large unilamellar vesicles due to the entry of a quencher through the gramicidin channels. We use the fluorescence indicator/quencher pair 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonate (ANTS)/Tl(+) that has been successfully used in other fluorescence quenching assays. Tl(+) permeates the lipid bilayer slowly but passes readily through conducting gramicidin channels. The method is scalable and suitable for both mechanistic studies and high-throughput screening of small molecules for bilayer-perturbing, and potential "off-target", effects. We find that results using this method are in good agreement with previous electrophysiological results.},

Here we introduce a conceptually new type of synthetic ligands, self-localizing ligands (SLLs), which spontaneously localize to specific subcellular regions in mammalian cells. We show that SLLs bind their target proteins and relocate (tether) them rapidly from the cytoplasm to their targeting sites, thus serving as synthetic protein translocators. SLL-induced protein translocation enables us to manipulate diverse synthetic/endogenous signaling pathways. The method is also applicable to reversible protein translocation and allows control of multiple proteins at different times and locations in the same cell. These results demonstrate the usefulness of SLLs in the spatial (and temporal) control of intracellular protein distribution and biological processes, opening a new direction in the design of small-molecule tools or drugs for cell regulation.},

  Abstract                 = {As the only member of the family of G-protein-coupled receptors for which atomic coordinates are available, rhodopsin is widely studied for insight into the molecular mechanism of G-protein-coupled receptor activation. The currently available structures refer to the inactive, dark state, of rhodopsin, rather than the light-activated metarhodopsin II (Meta II) state. A model for the Meta II state is proposed here by analyzing elastic network normal modes in conjunction with experimental data. Key mechanical features and interactions broken/formed in the proposed model are found to be consistent with the experimental data. The model is further tested by using a set of Meta II fluorescence decay rates measured to empirically characterize the deactivation of rhodopsin mutants. The model is found to correctly predict 93\% of the experimentally observed effects in 119 rhodopsin mutants for which the decay rates and misfolding data have been measured, including a systematic analysis of Cys-->Ser replacements reported here. Based on the detailed comparison between model and experiments, a cooperative activation mechanism is deduced that couples retinal isomerization to concerted changes in conformation, facilitated by the intrinsic dynamics of rhodopsin. A global hinge site is identified near the retinal-binding pocket that ensures the efficient propagation of signals from the central transmembrane region to both cytoplasmic and extracellular ends. The predicted activation mechanism opens the transmembrane helices at the critical G-protein binding cytoplasmic domain. This model provides a detailed, mechanistic description of the activation process, extending experimental observations and yielding new insights for further tests.},

  Abstract                 = {A short-range effective potential for long-range electrostatic interactions in homogeneously disordered condensed phase systems has been determined with a novel approach to coarse-graining in interaction space. As opposed to coarse-graining the system resolution, this approach "coarsens" the system's interactions by mapping multiple configurations of an accurate long-range atomistic potential onto a more efficient, short-range effective potential with a force-matching (FM) method. Developing an empirical potential in this manner is fundamentally different from existing strategies because it utilizes condensed-phase (as opposed to gas-phase) atomistic interactions to determine general pair potentials defined on distance meshes (as opposed to fitting predetermined functional forms). The resulting short-range ( approximately 10 A) effective potential reproduces structural, dynamical, and many thermodynamic properties of liquid water, ions in water, and hydrophobes in water, with unprecedented accuracy. The effective potential is also shown to be transferable to a nonaqueous molten salt system. With continued development, such effective potentials may provide an accurate and highly efficient alternative to Ewald-based long-range electrostatics methods.},

  Abstract                 = {A methodology is described to systematically derive coarse-grained (CG) force fields for molecular liquids from the underlying atomistic-scale forces. The coarse graining of an interparticle force field is accomplished by the application of a force-matching method to the trajectories and forces obtained from the atomistic trajectory and force data for the CG sites of the targeted system. The CG sites can be associated with the centers of mass of atomic groups because of the simplicity in the evaluation of forces acting on these sites from the atomistic data. The resulting system is called a multiscale coarse-grained (MS-CG) representation. The MS-CG method for liquids is applied here to water and methanol. For both liquids one-site and two-site CG representations without an explicit treatment of the long-ranged electrostatics have been derived. In addition, for water a two-site model having the explicit long-ranged electrostatics has been developed. To improve the thermodynamic properties (e.g., pressure and density) for the MS-CG models, the constraint for the instantaneous virial was included into the force-match procedure. The performance of the resulting models was evaluated against the underlying atomistic simulations and experiment. In contrast with existing approaches for coarse graining of liquid systems, the MS-CG approach is general, relies only on the interatomic interactions in the reference atomistic system.},

  abstract    = {An interesting observation was found during our continued studies on the hydrolysis of ibuprofen esters by Candida rugosa lipase (CRL). An important role is played by pH in the stereospecific hydrolysis of these esters. The flap region of CRL plays a significant role in the access of the substrate to the active site of the enzyme. At pH 5.6, 48\% of the methyl ester and 5\% of the butyl ester of ibuprofen were hydrolysed in 5.5 h, whereas at pH 7.2, 9\% of methyl ester and 45\% of the butyl ester of ibuprofen was hydrolysed in a identical reaction time using CRL. This lead us to assume that CRL prefers the methyl ester of ibuprofen as a substrate at an acidic pH and the butyl ester of ibuprofen at a neutral pH. Therefore, in order to understand the role of pH in the substrate selection by CRL for the esters of ibuprofen we used the crystallographic coordinates of the open form of the CRL (1CRL) for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations under acidic and neutral conditions for 2 ns using GROMACS. The final structures obtained after simulation in acidic and neutral conditions were compared with the energy-minimized structure, and the root-mean-square deviations (r.m.s.ds) were calculated. The r.m.s.d. of the CRL flap at neutral pH was found to be greater than that of the CRL flap at acidic pH. The extent to which the flap opens at neutral pH allowed the bulkier substrate, the butyl ester of ibuprofen, to diffuse into the active site and provides the best enzyme-substrate fit for this specific substrate. At acidic pH there is a decreased opening of the flap thereby accommodating a more compact substrate, namely the methyl ester of ibuprofen. Thus, simulation experiments using MD provide reasonable insight for the pH-dependent substrate selectivity of CRL in aqueous environments.},

We show how the general phase-field equations can be derived within a thermodynamic consistent picture. We analyze a general form of the bending energy, where the Helfrich bending force is treated as a special case. The dynamical evolution equation derived here for the velocity field allows one to write down a constitutive law of the composite fluid: The ambient fluid plus the membrane. This constitutive law has a viscoelastic form, the viscous part arises from the fluid, while the elastic one represents the action of the membrane. It is shown that the elastic stress tensor is not symmetric, owing to bending torque, inherent to a diffuse membrane model.},

  Abstract                 = {The light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin (bR) is a transmembrane protein that uses large conformational changes for proton transfer from the cytoplasmic to the extracellular regions. Crystal structures, due to their solvent conditions, do not resolve the effect of lipid molecules on these protein conformational changes. To begin to understand the molecular details behind such large conformational changes, we simulated two conformations of wild-type bacteriorhodopsin, one of the dark-adapted state and the second of an intermediate (M-O) state, each within an explicit dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) lipid bilayer. The simulations included all-hydrogen and all-atom representations of protein, lipid, and water and were performed for 20 ns. We investigate the equilibrium properties and the dynamic motions of the two conformations in the lipid setting. We note that the conformational state of the M-O intermediate bR remains markedly different from the dark-adapted bR state in that the M-O intermediate shows rearrangement of the cytoplasmic portions of helices C, F, and G, and nearby loops. This difference in the states remained throughout the simulations, and the results are stable on the molecular dynamics timescale and provide an illustration of the changes in both lipid and water that help to stabilize a particular state. Our analysis focuses on how the environment adjusts to these two states and on how the dynamics of the helices, loops, and water molecules can be related to the pump mechanism of bacteriorhodopsin. For example, water generally behaves in the same manner on the extracellular sides of both simulations but is decreased in the cytoplasmic region of the M-O intermediate. We suspect that the different water behavior is closely related to the fluctuations of microcavities volume in the protein interior, which is strongly coupled to the collective motion of the protein. Our simulation result suggests that experimental observation can be useful to verify a decreased number of waters in the cytoplasmic regions of the late-intermediate stages by measuring the rate of water exchange with the interior of the protein.}

Solution NMR conformation of the cationic antimicrobial lipopeptide C12LF11 (N-lauryl undecapeptide LF11 based on human lactoferrin) shows a completely reorganized peptide conformation in micellar environment in comparison to the parent peptide. As a striking difference to other known lipopeptide structures, the acyl chain of C12LF11 forms an integral part of the hydrophobic cluster with long-range effects on the peptide conformation. The peptide C-terminus forms two helical segments and is better defined in DPC than in SDS micelles. Peptide acylation improved particularly the activity against the bacterial strains with short oligosaccharide (rough) LPS chemotype and protected mice against the endotoxic shock. The profound structural effects of acylation demonstrate that this type of modification allows a manipulation of the peptide's conformation and improves their bioactivity.},

  abstract =             {Understanding the mechanism of G-protein coupled receptors action is of major interest for drug design. The visual rhodopsin is the prototype structure for the family A of G-protein coupled receptors. Upon photoisomerization of the covalently bound retinal chromophore, visual rhodopsins undergo a large-scale conformational change that prepares the receptor for a productive interaction with the G-protein. The mechanism by which the local perturbation of the retinal cis-trans isomerization is transmitted throughout the protein is not well understood. The crystal structure of the visual rhodopsin from squid solved recently suggests that a chain of water molecules extending from the retinal toward the cytoplasmic side of the protein may play a role in the signal transduction from the all-trans retinal geometry to the activated receptor. As a first step toward understanding the role of water in rhodopsin function, we performed a molecular dynamics simulation of squid rhodopsin embedded in a hydrated bilayer of polyunsaturated lipid molecules. The simulation indicates that the water molecules present in the crystal structure participate in favorable interactions with side chains in the interhelical region and form a persistent hydrogen-bond network in connecting Y315 to W274 via D80.},

To begin to understand how changes in the structure and dynamics of the retinal are transmitted to the protein, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of squid rhodopsin with 11-cis and all-trans retinal, and with two different force fields for describing the retinal molecule. The results indicate that structural rearrangements in the binding pocket, albeit small, propagate toward the cytoplasmic side of the protein, and affect the dynamics of internal water molecules. The sensitivity of the active-site interactions on the retinal force-field parameters highlights the coupling between the retinal molecule and its immediate protein environment.},

  abstract =             {Heterotrimeric G proteins become activated after they form a catalytically active complex with activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and GTP replaces GDP on the G protein ÃÂ±-subunit. This transient coupling can be stabilized by nucleotide depletion, resulting in an empty-nucleotide G proteinÃ¢ÂÂGPCR complex. Efficient and reproducible formation of conformationally homogeneous GPCRÃ¢ÂÂGt complexes is a prerequisite for structural studies. Herein, we report isolation conditions that enhance the stability and preserve the activity and proper stoichiometry of productive complexes between the purified prototypical GPCR, rhodopsin (Rho), and the rod cell-specific G protein, transducin (Gt). Binding of purified Gt to photoactivated Rho (Rho*) in n-dodecyl ÃÂ²-D-maltoside (DDM) examined by gel filtration chromatography was generally modest, and purified complexes provided heterogeneous ratios of protein components, most likely because of excess detergent. Rho*Ã¢ÂÂGt complex stability and activity were greatly increased by addition of phospholipids such as DOPC, DOPE, and DOPS and asolectin to detergent-containing solutions of these proteins. In contrast, native Rho*Ã¢ÂÂGt complexes purified directly from light-exposed bovine ROS membranes by sucrose gradient centrifugation exhibited improved stability and the expected 2:1 stoichiometry between Rho* and Gt. These results strongly indicate a lipid requirement for stable complex formation in which the likely oligomeric structure of Rho provides a superior platform for coupling to Gt, and phospholipids likely form a matrix to which Gt can anchor through its myristoyl and farnesyl groups. Our findings also demonstrate that the choice of detergent and purification method is critical for obtaining highly purified, stable, and active complexes with appropriate stoichiometry between GPCRs and G proteins needed for structural studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Rhodopsin (Rho) is a G protein-coupled receptor that initiates phototransduction in rod photoreceptors. High expression levels of Rho in the disc membranes of rod outer segments and the propensity of Rho to form higher oligomeric structures are evident from atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and chemical cross-linking experiments. To explore the structural and functional properties of Rho in n-dodecyl-beta-maltoside, frequently used to purify heterologously expressed Rho and its mutants, we used gel filtration techniques, blue native gel electrophoresis, and functional assays. Here, we show that in micelles containing n-dodecyl-beta-maltoside at concentrations greater than 3 mM, Rho is present as a single monomer per detergent micelle. In contrast, in 12 mM 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethyl-ammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), micelles contain mostly dimeric Rho. The cognate G protein transducin (Gt) appears to have a preference for binding to the Rho dimer, and the complexes fall apart in the presence of guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. Cross-linked Rho dimers release the chromophore at a slower rate than monomers and are much more resistant to heat denaturation. Both Rho(*) monomers and dimers are capable of activating Gt, and both of them are phosphorylated by Rho kinase. Rho expressed in HEK293 cells is also readily cross-linked by a bifunctional reagent. These studies provide an explanation of how detergent influences the oligomer-dimermonomer equilibrium of Rho and describe the functional characterization of Rho monomers and dimers in detergent.},

Sampling totaled nearly 500 mus-the most extensive published to date for a system of villin's size in explicit solvent with all atom detail-and was in the form of tens of thousands of independent molecular dynamics trajectories, each several tens of nanoseconds in length. We report on kinetics sensitivity analyses that, using a set of short simulations, probed the role of water in villin's folding and sensitivity to the simulation's electrostatics treatment. By constructing Markovian state models (MSMs) from the collected data, we were able to propagate dynamics to times far beyond those directly simulated and to rapidly compute mean first passage times, long time kinetics (tens of microseconds), and evolution of ensemble property distributions over long times, otherwise currently impossible. We also tested our MSM by using it to predict the structure of villin de novo.},

  Abstract                 = {The specificity of the stress-produced antimicrobial peptide cateslytin to fungi membranes has been investigated using complex membrane models made of zwitterionic and negatively charged lipids, cholesterol, or ergosterol. Noninvasive solid-state NMR of deuterated neutral and negatively charged lipids, together with IR spectroscopy, afforded following both changes in membrane fluidity and in peptide secondary structure. Cateslytin, by adopting an aggregated antiparallel beta-sheeted structure at membrane interfaces, induces a fluid/rigid membrane separation on ergosterol-containing models only. This effect is accounted for by a 2-fold electronic interaction: attractive dipole-dipole between basic arginine residues and negatively charged lipid head groups, and attractive cation-pi between arginine and the conjugated pi electrons of the ergosterol fused-ring system. This complex leads to fluid/thinner membranes that laterally separate out from rigid/thicker membranes that are not bound by cateslytin. The boundary defects occurring between domains span several angstroms, as probed by NMR of perdeuterated lipids, and are proposed to trigger peptide permeation through membranes. The intrinsic greater membrane fluidity of ergosterol/acidic lipid components in fungi is shown to be one of the key factors for specific cateslytin biological action.},

  Abstract                 = {AIM: To determine the kinetics of platelet activating factor (PAF) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) receptor desensitisation during intestinal inflammation induced by trinitrobenzenesulphonic acid (TNB) instillation and to study the relation between receptor regulation, inflammatory lesions, and PAF content of the gut wall. METHODS: Receptor desensitisation was assessed on isolated smooth muscle cells from the circular layer. PAF content of the intestinal wall was determined by thin layer chromatography and radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: After an acute inflammatory phase on day 1, subacute changes appeared in TNB instilled ileum, with a maximal intensity on day 6. In control animals, PAF 10 nM and PGE2 10 nM provoked a maximal contraction in the range of 24\% of cell shortening. On days 1 and 3 after intestinal instillation of TNB, PAF induced contraction was not altered whereas the effect of PGE2 was progressively desensitised (2 logM rightward shift of its concentration-response curve: Cmax = 1 microM; p < 0.01). Between days 4 and 6, the concentration-response curve of PGE2 shifted by only 1 logM (p < 0.05) whereas the curve of PAF induced contraction shifted by 2 logM (Cmax = 1 microM; p < 0.01). The PAF content of the ileal wall was maximal between days 3 and 5 (300 ng/mg tissue). On days 10 and 15, PAF and PGE2 induced contractions were similar to those observed on day 1, and PAF content returned to basal. CONCLUSION: Inflammation induced by TNB instillation triggers PAF and PGE2 receptor desensitisation; this is dependent on the duration of inflammation and correlates with PAF content in the ileum. This receptor desensitisation may play a protective role by preventing overstimulation of intestinal smooth muscle cells.},

  Abstract                 = {The mechanism of ion channel voltage gating-how channels open and close in response to voltage changes-has been debated since Hodgkin and Huxley's seminal discovery that the crux of nerve conduction is ion flow across cellular membranes. Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we show how a voltage-gated potassium channel (KV) switches between activated and deactivated states. On deactivation, pore hydrophobic collapse rapidly halts ion flow. Subsequent voltage-sensing domain (VSD) relaxation, including inward, 15-angstrom S4-helix motion, completes the transition. On activation, outward S4 motion tightens the VSD-pore linker, perturbing linker-S6-helix packing. Fluctuations allow water, then potassium ions, to reenter the pore; linker-S6 repacking stabilizes the open pore. We propose a mechanistic model for the sodium/potassium/calcium voltage-gated ion channel superfamily that reconciles apparently conflicting experimental data.},

AQP0 is remarkably less water permeable than other aquaporins, but the structural basis and biological significance of this low permeability remain uncertain, as does the permeability of the protein in a reported junctional form. To address these issues, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of water transport through membrane-embedded AQP0 in both its (octameric) junctional and (tetrameric) nonjunctional forms. From our simulations, we measured an osmotic permeability for the nonjunctional form that agrees with experiment and found that the distinct dynamics of the conserved, lumen-protruding side chains of Tyr-23 and Tyr-149 modulate water passage, accounting for the slow permeation. The junctional and nonjunctional forms conducted water equivalently, in contrast to a previous suggestion based on static crystal structures that water conduction is lost on junction formation. Our analysis suggests that the low water permeability of AQP0 may help maintain the mechanical stability of the junction. We hypothesize that the structural features leading to low permeability may have evolved in part to allow AQP0 to form junctions that both conduct water and contribute to the organizational structure of the fiber cell tissue and microcirculation within it, as required to maintain transparency of the lens.},

  Abstract                 = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation has become one of the key tools to obtain deeper insights into biological systems using various levels of descriptions such as all-atom, united-atom, and coarse-grained models. Recent advances in computing resources and MD programs have significantly accelerated the simulation time and thus increased the amount of trajectory data. Although many laboratories routinely perform MD simulations, analyzing MD trajectories is still time consuming and often a difficult task. ST-analyzer, http://im.bioinformatics.ku.edu/st-analyzer, is a standalone graphical user interface (GUI) toolset to perform various trajectory analyses. ST-analyzer has several outstanding features compared to other existing analysis tools: (i) handling various formats of trajectory files from MD programs, such as CHARMM, NAMD, GROMACS, and Amber, (ii) intuitive web-based GUI environment--minimizing administrative load and reducing burdens on the user from adapting new software environments, (iii) platform independent design--working with any existing operating system, (iv) easy integration into job queuing systems--providing options of batch processing either on the cluster or in an interactive mode, and (v) providing independence between foreground GUI and background modules--making it easier to add personal modules or to recycle/integrate pre-existing scripts utilizing other analysis tools. The current ST-analyzer contains nine main analysis modules that together contain 18 options, including density profile, lipid deuterium order parameters, surface area per lipid, and membrane hydrophobic thickness. This article introduces ST-analyzer with its design, implementation, and features, and also illustrates practical analysis of lipid bilayer simulations.},

Recent advances in synthetic lipopeptides, driven by the biochemical and biophysical research, expanded their spectrum of antimicrobial activity and reduced their size to achieve economically viable production. Lipopeptides, consisting of a short peptide chain conjugated with an acyl chain, form a structurally defined conformation, which inserts into the bacterial membrane and dissipates its transmembrane potential. In addition to antimicrobial activity, synthetic lipopeptides also suppress inflammation through the neutralization of bacterial agonists of the innate immune response, synergize with conventional antibiotics and have improved proteolytic stability. Activities in animal models indicate that synthetic lipopeptides may surpass the natural lipopeptides as the perspective class of anti-infective agents.},

  Abstract                 = {The alkaline earth metals calcium and magnesium are critically involved in many biomolecular processes. To understand the hydration thermodynamics of these ions, we have performed molecular dynamics simulations using a polarizable potential. Particle-mesh Ewald for point multipoles has been applied to the calculation of electrostatic interactions. The parameters in this model have been determined from an ab initio quantum mechanical calculation of dimer interactions between ions and water. Two methods for ion solvation free energy calculation, free energy perturbation, and the Bennett acceptance ratio have been compared. Both predict results consistent with other theoretical estimations while the Bennett approach leads to a much smaller statistical error. Based on the Born theory and the ion-oxygen radial distribution functions, we estimate the effective size of the ions in solution, concluding that K(+) > Na(+) congruent with Ca(2+) > Mg(2+). There appears to be much stronger perturbation in water structure, dynamics, and dipole moment around the divalent cations than the monovalent K(+) and Na(+). The average water coordination numbers for Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) are 7.3 and 6, respectively. The lifetime of water molecules in the first solvation shell of Mg(2+) is on the order of hundreds of picoseconds, in contrast to only few picoseconds for Ca(2+), K(+), or Na(+).},

  Abstract                 = {Many naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides comprise cationic linear sequences with the potential to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical conformation. We designed a linear 18-residue peptide that adopted an amphipathic beta-sheet structure when it was bound to lipids. In comparison to a 21-residue amphipathic alpha-helical peptide of equal charge and hydrophobicity, this peptide possessed more similar antimicrobial activity and greater selectivity in binding to and inducing leakage in vesicles composed of bacterial membrane lipids than vesicles composed of mammalian membrane lipids (J. Blazyk, R. Weigand, J. Klein, J. Hammer, R. M. Epand, R. F. Epand, W. L. Maloy, and U. P. Kari, J. Biol. Chem. 276:27899-27906, 2001). Here, we compare two systematically designed families of linear cationic peptides to evaluate the importance of amphipathicity for determination of antimicrobial activity. Each peptide contains six lysine residues and is amidated at the carboxyl terminus. The first family consists of five peptides with various capacities to form amphipathic beta-sheet structures. The second family consists of six peptides with various potentials to form amphipathic alpha helices. Only those peptides that can form a highly amphipathic structure (either a beta sheet or an alpha helix) possessed significant antimicrobial activities. Striking differences in the abilities to bind to and induce leakage in membranes and lipid vesicles were observed for the two families. Overall, the amphipathic beta-sheet peptides are less lytic than their amphipathic alpha-helical counterparts, particularly toward membranes containing phosphatidylcholine, a lipid commonly found in mammalian plasma membranes. Thus, it appears that antimicrobial peptides that can form an amphipathic beta-sheet conformation may offer a selective advantage in targeting bacterial cells.},

  Abstract                 = {The overlapping biological behaviors between some cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) suggest both common and different membrane interaction mechanisms. We thus explore the capacity of selected CPPs and AMPs to reorganize the planar distribution of binary lipid mixtures by means of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Additionally, membrane integrity assays and circular dichroism (CD) experiments were performed. Two CPPs (Penetratin and RL16) and AMPs belonging to the dermaseptin superfamily (Drs B2 and C-terminal truncated analog [1-23]-Drs B2 and two plasticins DRP-PBN2 and DRP-PD36KF) were selected. Herein we probed the impact of headgroup charges and acyl chain composition (length and unsaturation) on the peptide/lipid interaction by using binary lipid mixtures. All peptides were shown to be alpha-helical in all the lipid mixtures investigated, except for the two CPPs and [1-23]-Drs B2 in the presence of zwitterionic lipid mixtures where they were rather unstructured. Depending on the lipid composition and peptide sequence, simple binding to the lipid surface that occur without affecting the lipid distribution is observed in particular in the case of AMPs. Recruitments and segregation of lipids were observed, essentially for CPPs, without a clear relationship between peptide conformation and their effect in the lipid lateral organization. Nonetheless, in most cases after initial electrostatic recognition between the peptide charged amino acids and the lipid headgroups, the lipids with the lowest phase transition temperature were selectively recruited by cationic peptides while those with the highest phase transition were segregated. Membrane activities of CPPs and AMPs could be thus related to their preferential interactions with membrane defects that correspond to areas with marked fluidity. Moreover, due to the distinct membrane composition of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, lateral heterogeneity may be differently affected by cationic peptides leading to either uptake or/and antimicrobial activities.},

  Abstract                 = {Considerable evidence has accumulated in recent years suggesting that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) associate in the plasma membrane to form homo- and/or heteromers. Nevertheless, the stoichiometry, fraction and lifetime of such receptor complexes in living cells remain topics of intense debate. Motivated by experimental data suggesting differing stabilities for homomers of the cognate human Î²1- and Î²2-adrenergic receptors, we have carried out approximately 160 microseconds of biased molecular dynamics simulations to calculate the dimerization free energy of crystal structure-based models of these receptors, interacting at two interfaces that have often been implicated in GPCR association under physiological conditions. Specifically, results are presented for simulations of coarse-grained (MARTINI-based) and atomistic representations of each receptor, in homodimeric configurations with either transmembrane helices TM1/H8 or TM4/3 at the interface, in an explicit lipid bilayer. Our results support a definite contribution to the relative stability of GPCR dimers from both interface sequence and configuration. We conclude that Î²1- and Î²2-adrenergic receptor homodimers with TM1/H8 at the interface are more stable than those involving TM4/3, and that this might be reconciled with experimental studies by considering a model of oligomerization in which more stable TM1 homodimers diffuse through the membrane, transiently interacting with other protomers at interfaces involving other TM helices.},

During the simulation of the histamine-hH4R complex, considerable changes occurred in the hH4R structure as well as in the interaction pattern of histamine at the binding site. These changes are in agreement with experimental data published on GPCR activation. In particular, the intracellular side of TM helix VI moved significantly away from TM helices III and VII. Moreover, histamine formed an interaction with Asn147 (4.57) that was previously proved to be important in hH4R activation. Results of the MD simulations of the native hH4R and the JNJ7777120-hH4R complex suggest that these models represent an inactive conformation of hH4R. MD simulation in the presence of JNJ7777120 resulted in the movement of the intracellular side of TM helix VI in the direction of TM helix III. Snapshots of the simulations may serve as functionally relevant models in the development of novel hH4R ligands in the future.},

The torsional parameters were determined by fitting to rotational energy profiles obtained from ab initio molecular orbital calculations at the RHF/6-31G*//RHF/6-31G* level for more than 50 organic molecules and ions. The quality of the fits was high with average errors for conformational energies of less than 0.2 kcal/mol. The force-field results for molecular structures are also demonstrated to closely match the ab initio predictions. The nonbonded parameters were developed in conjunction with Monte Carlo statistical mechanics simulations by computing thermodynamic and structural properties for 34 pure organic liquids including alkanes, alkenes, alcohols, ethers, acetals, thiols, sulfides, disulfides, aldehydes, ketones, and amides. Average errors in comparison with experimental data are 2% for heats of vaporization and densities. The Monte Carlo simulations included sampling all internal and intermolecular degrees of freedom. It is found that such non-polar and monofunctional systems do not show significant condensed-phase effects on internal energies in going from the gas phase to the pure liquids.},

The test case that has been examined is liquid hexane. OPLS potential functions have been used with sampling of external motions and internal angle bending and torsions. The BOSS 3.6 and AMBER 4.0 programs were used to perform the internal-coordinate Monte Carlo and Cartesian molecular dynamics simulations, respectively, for samples of 267 molecules in the NPT ensemble at 25 degrees C and 1 atm with periodic boundary conditions. The initial configurations of the system were equilibrated with the-hexane molecules in the all trans configuration. The major findings are (1) the Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics results for thermodynamic properties and conformer populations are in accord, (2) the conformer populations reach equilibrium in ca. 10(7) Monte Carlo configurations or 100 ps of molecular dynamics, and (3) the molecular dynamics calculations require 1.6-3.8 times more computer time to achieve the same level of convergence as the Monte Carlo simulations. The viability of internal-coordinate Monte Carlo methodology contrasts with earlier notions on the inefficiency of Cartesian Monte Carlo methods. Monte Carlo sampling in related contexts such as for side-chain torsional motion in proteins appears promising.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiple strains of Bacillus subtilis were demonstrated to stimulate plant defense responses, and cyclic lipopeptides may be involved in the elicitation of this induced systemic resistance phenomenon. Here, we further investigated molecular events underlying the interaction between such lipopeptides and plant cells. Addition of surfactin but not fengycin or iturin in the micromolar range to tobacco cell suspensions induced defense-related early events such as extracellular medium alkalinization coupled with ion fluxes and reactive oxygen species production. Surfactin also stimulated the defense enzymes phenylalanine ammonia lyase and lipoxygenase and modified the pattern of phenolics produced by the elicited cells. The occurrence of these surfactin-elicited early events is closely related to Ca(2+) influx and dynamic changes in protein phosphorylation but is not associated with any marked phytotoxicity or adverse effect on the integrity and growth potential of the treated tobacco cells. Reduced activity of some homologues also indicates that surfactin perception is dictated by structural clues in both the acyl moiety and cyclic peptide part. Our results suggest that these molecules could interact without irreversible pore formation but in a way sufficient to induce disturbance or transient channeling in the plasma membrane that can, in turn, activate a biochemical cascade of molecular events leading to defensive responses. The present study sheds new light not only on defense-related events induced following recognition of amphiphilic lipopeptides from Bacillus spp. but also more globally on the way elicitors from beneficial bacteria can be perceived by host plant cells.},

Here, we explore the thermodynamic stability and dipolar orientation of such 1D water chains from nanoscopic to macroscopic dimensions. We show that a dipole lattice model accurately recovers key properties of 1D confined water when compared to atomically detailed simulations. In a major reduction in computational complexity, we represent the dipole model in terms of effective Coulombic charges, which allows us to study pores of macroscopic lengths in equilibrium with a water bath (or vapor). We find that at ambient conditions, the water chains filling the tube are essentially continuous up to macroscopic dimensions. At reduced water vapor pressure, we observe a 1D Ising-like filling/emptying transition without a true phase transition in the thermodynamic limit. In the filled state, the chains of water molecules in the tube remain dipole-ordered up to macroscopic lengths of Ã¢ÂÂ0.1 mm, and the dipolar order is estimated to persist for times up to Ã¢ÂÂ0.1 s. The observed dipolar order in continuous water chains is a precondition for the use of nanoconfined 1D water as mediator of fast long-range proton transport, e.g., in fuel cells. For water-filled nanotube bundles and membranes, we expect anti-ferroelectric behavior, resulting in a rich phase diagram similar to that of a 2D Coulomb gas.},

  abstract             = {Abstract: Lipid bilayers provide a natural anisotropic environment for membrane proteins and can serve as apolar reservoirs for lipid-derived second messengers or lipophilic drugs. Partitioning of lipophilic agents changes the lateral pressure distribution in the bilayer, affecting integral proteins. p-Hydroxybenzoic acid esters (parabens) are amphipathic compounds widely used as food and cosmetics preservatives, but the mechanisms of their broad antibacterial action are unknown. Here we describe effects of ethyl, propyl, and butyl parabens on the gating of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel of small conductance (MscS) and compare them with the surface activity and lateral pressure changes measured in lipid monolayers in the presence of these substances. Near the bilayermonolayer equivalence pressure of 35 mN/m, ethyl, propyl, or butyl paraben present in the subphase at 1 mM increased the surface pressure of the monolayer by 5, 12.5, or 20\%, respectively. No spontaneous activation of MscS channels was observed in patchclamp experiments with parabens added from either the cytoplasmic or periplasmic side. Increasing concentrations of parabens on the cytoplasmic side of excised patches shifted activation curves of MscS toward higher tensions. A good correlation between the pressure increases in monolayers and shifts in activation midpoints in patchclamp experiments suggested that the more hydrophobic parabens partition more strongly into the lipid and exert larger effects on channel gating through changes in lateral pressure. We show that cytoplasmically presented ethyl or butyl parabens both hasten the process of desensitization of MscS and influence inactivation differently. The higher rate of desensitization is likely due to increased lateral pressure in the cytoplasmic leaflet surrounding the gate. Neither of the parabens strongly affects the rate of recovery and does not seem to penetrate the TM2TM3 interhelical clefts in MscS. We conclude that the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscS provides a sensitive readout of lateral membrane pressure exerted by amphipathic molecules but may not be the primary target for the parabens in their antimicrobial activity.},

These liquids were chosen for their range of polarity and their representation of typical interactions found in proteins. From simulations at constant temperature and 1 atm pressure, the average errors in the computed densities and heats of vaporization are 3.8% and 5.1% with AMBER94 and 1.5% and 1.3% with OPLS-AA. With MMFF94, the computed densities and heats of vaporization for methanol and NMA are too low by 21- 27%, while butane at -0.5 degrees C does not stop expanding during the simulation, A MC simulation using MMFF94 for butane with the density fixed at the experimental value yields a 32% error in the energy of vaporization. Analyses show that the optimal C-H and H-H nonbonded interactions with MMFF94 are too weak and occur at too large separations. Scaling of the MMFF94 parameter A(i), which is linearly related to the atomic radii, by 0.92 yields improved results for liquid butane.},

  Abstract                 = {Topology has been shown to be an important determinant of many features of protein folding; however, the delineation of sequence effects on folding remains obscure. Furthermore, differentiation between the two influences proves difficult due to their intimate relationship. To investigate the effect of sequence in the absence of significant topological differences, we examined the folding mechanisms of segment B1 peptostreptococcal protein L and segment B1 of streptococcal protein G. These proteins share the same highly symmetrical topology. Despite this symmetry, neither protein folds through a symmetrical transition state. We analyzed the origins of this difference using theoretical models. We found that the strength of the interactions present in the N-terminal hairpin of protein L causes this hairpin to form ahead of the C-terminal hairpin. The difference in chain entropy associated with the formation of the hairpins of protein G proves sufficient to beget initiation of folding at the shorter C-terminal hairpin. Our findings suggest that the mechanism of folding may be understood by examination of the free energy associated with the formation of partially folded microstates.},

  Abstract                 = {The use of simple theoretical models has provided a considerable contribution to our present understanding of the means by which proteins adopt their native fold from the plethora of available unfolded states. A common assumption in building computationally tractable models has been the neglect of stabilizing non-native interactions in the class of models described as "GÅ-like." The focus of this study is the characterization of the folding of a number of proteins via a GÅ-like model, which aims to map a maximal amount of information reflecting the protein sequence onto a "minimalist" skeleton. This model is shown to contain sufficient information to reproduce the folding transition states of a number of proteins, including topologically analogous proteins that fold via different transition states. Remarkably, these models also demonstrate consistency with the general features of folding transition states thought to be stabilized by non-native interactions. This suggests that native interactions are the primary determinant of most protein folding transition states, and that non-native interactions lead only to local structural perturbations. A prediction is also included for an asymmetrical folding transition state of bacteriophage lambda protein W, which has yet to be subjected to experimental characterization.},

  Abstract                 = {Amphotericin B (AmB) is thought to exert its pharmacological effects by forming a barrel-stave assembly with ergosterol in fungal membranes. To examine the interaction between AmB and ergosterol (Erg) or cholesterol (Cho), (13)C- and (19)F-labelled covalent conjugates were prepared as reported previously (N. Matsumori et al. Chem. Biol. 2004, 11, 673-679). The CD spectra of the conjugates in a membrane-bound form suggested that the distance between the heptaene moieties of the ergosterol conjugates AmB-C(2)-(6-F)Erg 2 and AmB-C(2)-Erg 3 is similar to that of AmB in ergosterol-containing membranes, but significantly larger than that of AmB in nonsterol or cholesterol-containing membranes. These observations suggest that, as is the case with ergosterol-containing membranes, the conjugated sterol moiety prevents the close contact between the heptaene moieties within the membrane that would reduce channel conductivity of the AmB assemblies. To further investigate this bimolecular interaction, we recorded the solid-state NMR spectra of conjugates 2 and AmB-C(2)-(6-F)Cho 4, which are composed of uniformly (13)C-labelled AmB and 6-fluorinated ergosterol or cholesterol; the conjugates were expected to facilitate the estimation of distances between the fluorine and carbon atoms. By using rotor-synchronous double resonance (rotational echo double resonance of X cluster; RDX) experiments, we deduced the distance between the fluorine atom and its nearest carbon atom in the heptaene moiety of 2 to be less than 8.6 A. This indicates that the B ring of ergosterol comes close to the AmB polyene moiety. A conformational search of the AmB-ergosterol conjugate by using distance constraints derived from the RDX results suggested that ergosterol molecules possibly surround the AmB assembly, which is in contrast with the conventional image in which ergosterol is inserted into AmB molecules.},

Despite a 50 year history, there are two clinically important subtypes of ÃÂ²-adrenergic receptors (ÃÂ²ARs) called ÃÂ²1AR and ÃÂ²2AR that still are promising drug targets. Our study maps the interactions between nebivololÃ¢ÂÂone of the most efficient ÃÂ²-blocking agentsÃ¢ÂÂand the ÃÂ²2-adrenergic receptor by simulating two optical isomers of nebivolol: ssss-nebivolol and srrr-nebivolol. The srrr-configuration binds preferentially to ÃÂ²1AR and ÃÂ²2AR. The ssss-form has much lower binding affinity to both of them. Our work indicates that water is a very important component of the binding site of the ÃÂ²2AR receptor. We found that the higher stereoselectivity of the srrr-configuration is due to interactions with water molecules, which extensively hydrate the binding site of ÃÂ²2AR. By lowering the energy of binding, water enhanced the affinity of the srrr-form to ÃÂ²2AR. We also address the problem of ÃÂ²1AR/ÃÂ²2AR selectivity. At higher concentrations, all ÃÂ²-blocking agents lose their specificity and bind nonselectively, causing many adverse effects. Our simulations indicate that PHE194, TYR308, and ILE309 of the ÃÂ²2AR and the corresponding residues of the ÃÂ²1AR receptor may be important determinants of ÃÂ²1AR versus ÃÂ²2AR selectivity.},

The transfer activity coefficients ((s)y(H2O)) of the alkali metal ion complexes between nonaqueous solvents (s: acetonitrile, propylene carbonate, and methanol) and water have been calculated. These values have been compared with the literature values for 16C5 and 15-(2,5-dioxahexyl)-15-methyI-16-crown-5 (L16C5). In water, 16C5 and DM16C5 selectively complex Li+ over Na+ and K+. The complexing ability of DM16C5 for a given metal ion is generally lower than that of 16C5 and L16C5. The alkali metal ion complexes of all the crown ethers are much less stable in water than in s, and the selectivity and the substituent effects also depend upon the solvent. The (s)y(H2O) values provide the following information: the alkali metal ion and the ether oxygen atoms are greatly dehydrated upon complexation in water; the dehydration is most drastic for Na+; the dehydration for Na+ is hindered by the methyl groups of DM16C5 and facilitated by the electron-donating side arm of L16C5. The solvent effects upon complexation are explained in terms of solute-solvent interactions.},

  Abstract                 = {Dysregulated expression of the T helper 2 cytokine interleukin (IL)-4 is thought to play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of allergic asthma. The molecular basis for dysregulated IL-4 production is not well understood. We analyzed in detail the molecular factors involved in regulating IL-4 transcription in a well-characterized mouse model. In this model, A/J mice developed allergen-induced IL-4 cytokine gene expression, airway inflammation, and hyperresponsiveness, whereas C3H/HeJ (C3H) mice did not. Here we report that isolated splenocytes from A/J and C3H mice stimulated ex vivo with concanavalin A reproduced the cytokine phenotype observed in the airway after antigen challenge. We hypothesized that differences in splenocyte IL-4 production involved either polymorphisms in regulatory IL-4 promoter regions, or the expression and activation of transcription factors necessary for promoter transactivation in a strain-dependent manner. To address these questions, we first sequenced ~ 700 base pairs containing well-characterized IL-4 promoter regulatory elements using genomic DNA obtained from C3H and A/J mice. Next, we used electrophoretic mobility shift assays with relevant IL-4 promoter sequences to screen nuclear extracts isolated from A/J and C3H splenocytes for functional transcriptional factor complexes. Here we show that susceptibility to antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness is not due to polymorphisms in the IL-4 promoter, but is associated with preferential expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c in splenocyte nuclear extracts obtained from A/J mice. In conclusion, our data link dysregulated activation of a specific transcription factor with susceptibility to allergic airway inflammation.},

We observed the spontaneous formation of lipid bilayers from initial systems containing randomly placed lipids, water-counterions and DNA. In both the DPPC and DPPC/DMTAP simulations, the DNA molecule is located at the water-lipid headgroup interface, lying approximately parallel to the plane of the bilayer. We have also calculated the potential of mean force for transferring a DNA dodecamer through a DPPC/DMTAP bilayer. A high energetic barrier to DNA insertion into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer is observed. The DNA adopts a transmembrane orientation only in this region. Local bilayer deformation in the vicinity of the DNA molecule is observed, largely as a result of the DNA-DMTAP headgroup attraction.},

  Abstract                 = {The cholesterol-binding protein NAP-22 is a major component of the detergent-insoluble low-density fraction of rat brain. In this study, we found, using fluorescence microscopy, that native NAP-22, but not a demyristoylated form, binds to cholesterol-rich raft-like domains in planar-supported monolayers and remains bound after nonionic detergent extraction. NAP-22 also protects the cholesterol-rich domains during extraction by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin. The lateral mobility of this protein is much lower than that of other raft components in model membranes, suggesting that both cholesterol binding and inter-NAP-22 interactions markedly reduce its lateral diffusion. This study suggests that NAP-22 binding may be employed to image cholesterol-rich regions, such as caveolae/rafts, on the plasma membrane of cells, and preliminary efforts in that direction are presented.},

This work illustrates the strengths and capabilities of continuous constant pH molecular dynamics in exploring pH-dependent conformational transitions in proteins by revisiting an experimentally well studied model protein fragment, the C peptide from ribonuclease A. The simulation data reveal a bell-shaped pH profile for the total helix content, in agreement with experiment, and several pairs of electrostatic interactions that control the relative populations of unfolded and partially folded states of various helical lengths. The latter information greatly complements and extends that attainable by current experimental techniques. The present work paves the way for new and exciting applications, such as the study of pH-dependent molecular mechanism in the formation of amyloid comprising peptides from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {An unresolved question about GPCR function is the role of membrane components in receptor stability and activation. In particular, cholesterol is known to affect the function of membrane proteins, but the details of its effect on GPCRs are still elusive. Here, we describe how cholesterol modulates the behavior of the TM1-TM2-TM7-helix 8(H8) functional network that comprises the highly conserved NPxxY(x)(5,6)F motif, through specific interactions with the receptor. The inferences are based on the analysis of microsecond length molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of rhodopsin in an explicit membrane environment. Three regions on the rhodopsin exhibit the highest cholesterol density throughout the trajectory: the extracellular end of TM7, a location resembling the high-density sterol area from the electron microscopy data; the intracellular parts of TM1, TM2, and TM4, a region suggested as the cholesterol binding site in the recent X-ray crystallography data on beta(2)-adrenergic GPCR; and the intracellular ends of TM2-TM3, a location that was categorized as the high cholesterol density area in multiple independent 100 ns MD simulations of the same system. We found that cholesterol primarily affects specific local perturbations of the helical TM domains such as the kinks in TM1, TM2, and TM7. These local distortions, in turn, relate to rigid-body motions of the TMs in the TM1-TM2-TM7-H8 bundle. The specificity of the effects stems from the nonuniform distribution of cholesterol around the protein. Through correlation analysis we connect local effects of cholesterol on structural perturbations with a regulatory role of cholesterol in the structural rearrangements involved in GPCR function.},

  Abstract                 = {Erythromycin and other macrolides are effective for the treatment of chronic inflammatory airway diseases such as diffuse panbronchiolitis (DPB) and chronic sinusitis. The effect of macrolides in DPB is suggested to be anti-inflammatory rather than antibacterial. We investigated the effects of clarithromycin on interleukin-8 (IL-8) production using human peripheral monocytes and the human monocytic leukaemia cell line, THP-1. Bacterial extracts from Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Helicobacter pylori, as well as E. coli-derived lipopolysaccharide (LPS), induced IL-8 production. Clarithromycin suppressed this production in a dose-dependent manner in both monocytes and THP-1 cells (49.3-75.0\% inhibition at 10 mg/L). A luciferase reporter gene assay with plasmids containing a serially deleted IL-8 promoter fragment showed that both the activator protein-1 (AP-1) and/or the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kapp aB) binding sequences were responsible for the LPS and clarithromycin responsiveness of the IL-8 promoter. Consistently, in an electromobility shift assay, LPS increased the specific binding of both AP-1 and NF-kappaB, whereas clarithromycin suppressed it. Moreover, LPS and clarithromycin regulated three other promoters that have either the NF-kappa B or the AP-1 binding sequences: two synthetic (pAP-1-Luc and pNF-kappa B-Luc) and one naturally occurring (ELAM-Luc). Our results indicate that clarithromycin modified inflammation by sup-pressing IL-8 production and that clarithromycin may affect the expression of other genes through AP-1 and NF-kappa B. In addition to treatment of airway diseases, the anti-inflammatory effect of macrolides may be beneficial for the treatment of other inflammatory diseases such as chronic gastritis caused by H. pylori.},

The thermodynamic distribution constants of the electrolytes (M+.X- ) were determined and the transfer free energy, Delta G(t)(0), of the individual ions into water-saturated 1,2-DCE were evaluated using the extrathermodynamic assumption. The value of Delta G(t)(0) of alkali-metal ion increases almost linearly with increasing dehydration energy of metal ion except for Lithium. The relatively small value of Delta G(t)(0) for lithium is interpreted by the hydration of the lithium ion in the 1,2-DCE phase. The complex formation constants of the alkali-metal ions with poly(oxyethylene) derivatives in 1,2-DCE were evaluated by using the partition data of alkali-metal picrates. The order of the complex formation constant is Li+ < Na+ similar to K+ > Rb+ > Cs+ for any POE compounds.},

The mutual information expansion (MIE) provides a novel and systematic approach to extracting configurational entropy changes due to correlated motions from molecular simulations. We present the first application of the MIE method to protein-ligand binding using multiple molecular dynamics simulations to study the association of the ubiquitin E2 variant domain of the protein Tsg101 and an HIV-derived nonapeptide. This investigation utilizes the second-order MIE approximation, which accounts for correlations between all pairs of degrees of freedom. The computed change in configurational entropy is large and has a major contribution from changes in pairwise correlation. The results also reveal intricate structure-entropy relationships. Thus, the present analysis suggests that in order for a model of binding to be accurate, it must include a careful accounting of configurational entropy changes.},

The mutual information expansion is demonstrated to be equivalent to estimating the full-dimensional configurational probability density function (PDF) using the generalized Kirkwood superposition approximation (GKSA). While the mutual information expansion is derived to the full dimensionality of the molecule, the current application uses a truncated form of the expansion in which all fourth- and higher-order mutual information terms are neglected. Truncation of the mutual information expansion at the nth order is shown to be equivalent to approximating the full-dimensional PDF using joint PDFs with dimensionality of n or smaller by successive application of the GKSA. The expansion method is used to compute the absolute (classical) configurational entropy in a basis of bond-angle-torsion internal coordinates for several small molecules as well as the change in entropy upon binding for a small host-guest system. Convergence properties of the computed entropy values as a function of simulation time are investigated and comparisons are made with entropy values from the second generation Mining Minima software. These comparisons demonstrate a deviation in -TS of no more than about 2 kcal/mol for all cases in which convergence has been obtained.},

Various types of phospholipid systems, such as POPC-d(31), POPC-d(31)/POPG, and POPC-d(31)/cholesterol, were investigated to understand the membrane disruption mechanisms of magainin-2 and aurein-3.3 peptides at various peptide-to-lipid (P:L) ratios. The experimental lineshapes of anisotropic (31)P and (2)H ssNMR spectra measured on these peptide-lipid systems were simulated reasonably well by assuming the presence of supramolecular lipid assemblies, such as toroidal pores and thinned bilayers, in membranes. Furthermore, the observed decrease in the anisotropic frequency span of either (31)P or (2)H ssNMR spectra of oriented lipid bilayers, particularly when anionic POPG lipids are interacting with AMPs at high P:L ratios, can directly be explained by a thinned membrane surface model with fast lateral diffusive motions of lipids. The spectral analysis protocol we developed enables extraction of the lateral diffusion coefficients of lipids distributed on the curved surfaces of pores and thinned bilayers on a few nanometers scale.},

  abstract =             {PMID: 19839649 The Saccharomyces cerevisiae ÃÂ±-factor pheromone receptor, Ste2p, has been studied as a model for G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) structure and function. Dimerization has been demonstrated for many GPCRs, although the role(s) of dimerization in receptor function is disputed. Transmembrane domains one (TM1) and four (TM4) of Ste2p were shown previously to play a role in dimerization. In this study, single cysteine substitutions were introduced into a Cys-less Ste2p, and disulfide-mediated dimerization was assessed. Six residues in TM1 (L64 to M69) that had not been previously investigated and 19 residues in TM7 (T278 to A296) of which 15 were not previously investigated were mutated to create 25 single Cys-containing Ste2p molecules. Ste2p mutants V68C in TM1 and nine mutants in TM7 (cysteine substituted into residues 278, 285, 289, and 291 to 296) showed increased dimerization upon addition of an oxidizing agent in comparison to the background dimers formed by the Cys-less receptor. The formation of dimers was decreased for TM7 mutant receptors in the presence of ÃÂ±-factor indicating that ligand binding resulted in a conformational change that influenced dimerization. The effect of ligand on dimer formation suggests that dimers are formed in the resting state and the activated state of the receptor by different TM interactions.},

  abstract =    {The intramolecular interactions that stabilize the inactive conformation of rhodopsin are of primary importance in elucidating the mechanism of activation of this and other G protein-coupled receptors. In the present study, site-directed spin labeling is used to explore the role of a buried salt bridge between the protonated Schiff base at K296 in TM7 and its counterion at E113 in TM3. Spin-label sensors are placed at positions in the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin to monitor changes in the structure of the helix bundle caused by point mutations that disrupt the salt bridge. The single point mutations E113Q, G90D, and A292E, which were previously reported to cause constitutive activation of the apoprotein opsin, are found to cause profound movements of both TM3 and TM6 in the dark state, the latter of which is similar to that caused by light activation. The mutant M257Y, which constitutively activates opsin but does not disrupt the salt bridge, is shown to cause related but distinguishable structural changes. The double mutants E113Q/M257Y and G90D/M257Y produce strong activation of the receptor in the dark state. In the E113Q/M257Y mutant investigated with spin labeling, the movement of TM6 and other changes are exaggerated relative to either E113Q or M257Y alone. Collectively, the results provide structural evidence that the salt bridge is a key constraint maintaining the resting state of the receptor, and that the disruption of the salt bridge is the cause, rather than a consequence, of the TM6 motion that occurs upon activation.},

A lipopeptide produced by B. thuringiensis CMB26 was precipitated by adjusting the pH 2 with 3 n HCl and extracted using chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and reversed-phase HPLC. The molecular weight was estimated as 1447 Da by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Scanning electron and optical microscopies showed that the lipopeptide has activity against Escherichia coli O157:ac88, larvae of the cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae crucivora) and phytopathogenic fungi. The lipopeptide had cyclic structure and the amino acid composition was L-Glu, D-Orn, L-Tyr, D-allo-Thr, D-Ala, D-Val, L-Pro, and L-Ile in a molar ratio of 3:1:2:1:1:2:1:1. The purified lipopeptide showed the same amino acid composition as fengycin, but differed slightly in fatty acid composition, in which the double bond was at carbons 13-14 (m/z 303, 316) and there was no methyl group.A lipopeptide was purified and characterized from B. thuringiensis CMB26 and found to be similar to the lipopeptide fengycin. This lipopeptide can function as a biocontrol agent, and exhibits fungicidal, bactericidal, and insecticidal activity.Compared with surfactin and iturin, the lipopeptide from B. thuringiensis CMB26 showed stronger antifungal activity against phytopathogenic fungi. This lipopeptide is a candidate for the biocontrol of pathogens in agriculture.},

The activity depends on the length of the side chain. The benzyl side chain of N-(4-fluorobenzyl)vancomycin (FBV) has the minimal length sufficient for enhancement in activity against vancomycin-resistant pathogens. The conformation of FBV bound to the peptidoglycan in whole cells of S. aureus has been determined using rotational-echo double resonance NMR by measuring internuclear distances from the 19F of FBV to 13C and 15N labels incorporated into the cell-wall peptidoglycan. The hydrophobic side chain and aglycon of FBV form a cleft around the pentaglycyl bridge. FBV binds heterogeneously to the peptidoglycan as a monomer with the 19F positioned near the middle of the pentaglycyl bridge, approximately 7 \r{A} from the bridge link. This differs from the situation for N-(4-(4-fluorophenyl)benzyl)vancomycin complexed to the peptidoglycan where the 19F is located at the end of pentaglycyl bridge, 7 \r{A} from the cross-link.},

  abstract =    {G protein-coupled receptors exhibit a wide variety of signaling behaviors in response to different ligands. When a small label was incorporated on the cytosolic interface of transmembrane helix 6 (Cys-265), (19)F NMR spectra of the Î²2 adrenergic receptor (Î²2AR) reconstituted in maltose/neopentyl glycol detergent micelles revealed two distinct inactive states, an activation intermediate state en route to activation, and, in the presence of a G protein mimic, a predominant active state. Analysis of the spectra as a function of temperature revealed that for all ligands, the activation intermediate is entropically favored and enthalpically disfavored. Î²2AR enthalpy changes toward activation are notably lower than those observed with rhodopsin, a likely consequence of basal activity and the fact that the ionic lock and other interactions stabilizing the inactive state of Î²2AR are weaker. Positive entropy changes toward activation likely reflect greater mobility (configurational entropy) in the cytoplasmic domain, as confirmed through an order parameter analysis. Ligands greatly influence the overall changes in enthalpy and entropy of the system and the corresponding changes in population and amplitude of motion of given states, suggesting a complex landscape of states and substates.},

  abstract =    {The global fold of human cannabinoid type 2 (CB2 ) receptor in the agonist-bound active state in lipid bilayers was investigated by solid-state (13)C- and (15)N magic-angle spinning (MAS) NMR, in combination with chemical-shift prediction from a structural model of the receptor obtained by microsecond-long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Uniformly (13)C- and (15)N-labeled CB2 receptor was expressed in milligram quantities by bacterial fermentation, purified, and functionally reconstituted into liposomes. (13)C MAS NMR spectra were recorded without sensitivity enhancement for direct comparison of CÎ±, CÎ², and C=O bands of superimposed resonances with predictions from protein structures generated by MD. The experimental NMR spectra matched the calculated spectra reasonably well indicating agreement of the global fold of the protein between experiment and simulations. In particular, the (13) C chemical shift distribution of CÎ± resonances was shown to be very sensitive to both the primary amino acid sequence and the secondary structure of CB2. Thus the shape of the CÎ± band can be used as an indicator of CB2 global fold. The prediction from MD simulations indicated that upon receptor activation a rather limited number of amino acid residues, mainly located in the extracellular Loop 2 and the second half of intracellular Loop 3, change their chemical shifts significantly (â¥ 1.5 ppm for carbons and â¥ 5.0 ppm for nitrogens). Simulated two-dimensional (13) CÎ±(i)-(13)C=O(i) and (13)C=O(i)-(15)NH(i + 1) dipolar-interaction correlation spectra provide guidance for selective amino acid labeling and signal assignment schemes to study the molecular mechanism of activation of CB2 by solid-state MAS NMR.},

Biological properties of low molecular mass peptide dendrimers. Int. J. Pharm. 309, 208-217]. To extend our knowledge about their impact on biological systems, interactions between a group of low molecular mass lysine based dendrimers and model lipid bilayers were examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Conformational stability of dendrimers in 5-85 degrees C temperature range was confirmed by circular dichroism measurements (CD). The dendrimer structure has been shown to play an important role in interactions with the membranes. A two-step mechanism of dendrimer-bilayer interactions was proposed. The first step involves electrostatic attractions between dendrimers and polar lipid heads, while the second one is a result of hydrophobic interactions between acyl chains and arms of dendrimers. While one dendrimer did not interact with the membrane, another with long hydrophobic arms significantly perturbed the membrane. Nevertheless, for all tested dendrimers the main transition in DSC scans was retained that indicates that these compounds at the tested concentrations did not cause the loss of membrane integrity.},

  Abstract                 = {The fully hydrated liquid crystalline phase of the dimyristoylphosphatidycholine lipid bilayer at 30 degrees C was simulated using molecular dynamics with the CHARMM potential for five surface areas per lipid (A) in the range 55-65 A(2) that brackets the previously determined experimental area 60.6 A(2). The results of these simulations are used to develop a new hybrid zero-baseline structural model, denoted H2, for the electron density profile, rho(z), for the purpose of interpreting x-ray diffraction data. H2 and also the older hybrid baseline model were tested by fitting to partial information from the simulation and various constraints, both of which correspond to those available experimentally. The A, rho(z), and F(q) obtained from the models agree with those calculated directly from simulation at each of the five areas, thereby validating this use of the models. The new H2 was then applied to experimental dimyristoylphosphatidycholine data; it yields A = 60.6 +/- 0.5 A(2), in agreement with the earlier estimate obtained using the hybrid baseline model. The electron density profiles also compare well, despite considerable differences in the functional forms of the two models. Overall, the simulated rho(z) at A = 60.7 A(2) agrees well with experiment, demonstrating the accuracy of the CHARMM lipid force field; small discrepancies indicate targets for improvements. Lastly, a simulation-based model-free approach for obtaining A is proposed. It is based on interpolating the area that minimizes the difference between the experimental F(q) and simulated F(q) evaluated for a range of surface areas. This approach is independent of structural models and could be used to determine structural properties of bilayers with different lipids, cholesterol, and peptides.},

  abstract    = {CHARMM36 (C36) is the most up-to-date pairwise additive all-atom lipid force field and is able to accurately represent bilayer properties of saturated and monounsaturated lipid molecules in the natural constant particle, pressure, and temperature (NPT) ensemble. However, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycerco-3-phosphocholine (SDPC) bilayers of the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) chains result in inaccuracies of the surface area per lipid (SA), deuterium order parameters (S(CD)), and X-ray form factors. Therefore, in this study, high-level quantum mechanical calculations are used to improve the dihedral potential of neighboring double bonds, and the corresponding force field is referred to as C36p. The SA for SDPC at 303 K increases from 63.2 Â± 0.2 (C36) to 70.8 Â± 0.2 (C36p) Ã(2) and agrees favorably with X-ray diffraction results at 297 K. The resulting S(CD) are in excellent agreement with experimental values of both the sn-1 and sn-2 chains. Calculated NMR (13)C relaxation times and X-ray form factors from MD simulations of SDPC bilayers also agree with experiments. MD simulations of 1,2-diarachidonyl-phosphatidylcholine (DAPC) bilayers are used to further validate our force field parameters on a lipid with both chains containing PUFAs. As expected, the thickness of DAPC bilayers is reduced, and the SA is increased compared to the SDPC bilayers. This update in the PUFA force field should allow for accurate MD simulations of PUFA-containing bilayers in the NPT ensemble.},

  abstract    = {A significant modification to the additive all-atom CHARMM lipid force field (FF) is developed and applied to phospholipid bilayers with both choline and ethanolamine containing head groups and with both saturated and unsaturated aliphatic chains. Motivated by the current CHARMM lipid FF (C27 and C27r) systematically yielding values of the surface area per lipid that are smaller than experimental estimates and gel-like structures of bilayers well above the gel transition temperature, selected torsional, Lennard-Jones and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by targeting both quantum mechanical (QM) and experimental data. QM calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semiempirical QM studies on a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer in combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids: DPPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE); simulations of a low hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental surface area is on average within 2\%, and the density profiles agree well with neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments. NMR deuterium order parameters (S(CD)) are well predicted with the new FF, including proper splitting of the S(CD) for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for DPPC, POPE, and POPC bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of (13)C NMR relaxation rates of DPPC and the water distribution of low hydration DOPC bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly, the presented lipid FF, referred to as C36, allows for molecular dynamics simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble (NPT), and is anticipated to be of utility for simulations of pure lipid systems as well as heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {Much structural information is encoded in the internal distances; a distance matrix-based approach can be used to predict protein structure and dynamics, and for structural refinement. Our approach is based on the square distance matrix D = [r(ij)(2)] containing all square distances between residues in proteins. This distance matrix contains more information than the contact matrix C, that has elements of either 0 or 1 depending on whether the distance r (ij) is greater or less than a cutoff value r (cutoff). We have performed spectral decomposition of the distance matrices [Formula: see text], in terms of eigenvalues lambda kappa and the corresponding eigenvectors v kappa and found that it contains at most five nonzero terms. A dominant eigenvector is proportional to r (2)--the square distance of points from the center of mass, with the next three being the principal components of the system of points. By predicting r (2) from the sequence we can approximate a distance matrix of a protein with an expected RMSD value of about 7.3 A, and by combining it with the prediction of the first principal component we can improve this approximation to 4.0 A. We can also explain the role of hydrophobic interactions for the protein structure, because r is highly correlated with the hydrophobic profile of the sequence. Moreover, r is highly correlated with several sequence profiles which are useful in protein structure prediction, such as contact number, the residue-wise contact order (RWCO) or mean square fluctuations (i.e. crystallographic temperature factors). We have also shown that the next three components are related to spatial directionality of the secondary structure elements, and they may be also predicted from the sequence, improving overall structure prediction. We have also shown that the large number of available HIV-1 protease structures provides a remarkable sampling of conformations, which can be viewed as direct structural information about the dynamics. After structure matching, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain the important apparent motions for both bound and unbound structures. There are significant similarities between the first few key motions and the first few low-frequency normal modes calculated from a static representative structure with an elastic network model (ENM) that is based on the contact matrix C (related to D), strongly suggesting that the variations among the observed structures and the corresponding conformational changes are facilitated by the low-frequency, global motions intrinsic to the structure. Similarities are also found when the approach is applied to an NMR ensemble, as well as to atomic molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. Thus, a sufficiently large number of experimental structures can directly provide important information about protein dynamics, but ENM can also provide a similar sampling of conformations. Finally, we use distance constraints from databases of known protein structures for structure refinement. We use the distributions of distances of various types in known protein structures to obtain the most probable ranges or the mean-force potentials for the distances. We then impose these constraints on structures to be refined or include the mean-force potentials directly in the energy minimization so that more plausible structural models can be built. This approach has been successfully used by us in 2006 in the CASPR structure refinement (http://predictioncenter.org/caspR).},

  Abstract                 = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a large family of structurally similar proteins that respond to a chemically diverse array of physiological and environmental stimulants. Until recently, high-resolution structural information was limited to rhodopsin, a naturally abundant GPCR that is highly specialized for the detection of light. Non-rhodopsin GPCRs for diffusible hormones and neurotransmitters have proven more resistant to crystallography approaches, possibly because of their inherent structural flexibility and the need for recombinant expression. Recently, crystal structures of the human beta(2) adrenoceptor have been obtained using two different approaches to stabilize receptor protein and increase polar surface area. These structures, together with the existing structures of rhodopsin, represent an important first step in understanding how GPCRs work at a molecular level. Much more high-resolution information is needed for this important family of membrane proteins, however: for example, the structures of GPCRs from different families, structures bound to ligands having different efficacies, and structures of GPCRs in complex with G proteins and other signaling molecules. Methods to characterize the dynamic aspects of the GPCR architecture at high resolution will also be important.},

  Abstract                 = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are remarkably versatile signaling molecules. Members of this large family of membrane proteins respond to structurally diverse ligands and mediate most transmembrane signal transduction in response to hormones and neurotransmitters, and in response to the senses of sight, smell and taste. Individual GPCRs can signal through several G-protein subtypes and through G-protein-independent pathways, often in a ligand-specific manner. This functional plasticity can be attributed to structural flexibility of GPCRs and the ability of ligands to induce or to stabilize ligand-specific conformations. Here, we review what has been learned about the dynamic nature of the structure and mechanism of GPCR activation, primarily focusing on spectroscopic studies of purified human beta2 adrenergic receptor.},

The resonance Raman spectra and CD spectra of 13-demethylrhodopsin indicate that its chromophore, an analog in which the nonbonded interaction between the 10-H and the 13-CH3 groups is removed, is less distorted in the C10...C13 region than the native chromophore. The reduced torsional and hydrogen-out-of-plane resonance Raman intensities further indicate that the excited state potential energy surface has a much shallower slope along the isomerization coordinate. This is consistent with the decrease in quantum yield from 0.67 in rhodopsin to 0.47 in 13-demethylrhodopsin. The resonance Raman intensities show that the steric twist is reintroduced by addition of a methyl group at the C10 position. However, the quantum yield of 10-methyl-13-demethylrhodopsin is found to be only 0.35. This is attributed to nonisomorphous protein-analog interactions. The nonbonded interaction between the 10-hydrogen and the 13-methyl group in 11-cis-retinal makes this isomer particularly effective as the light-sensing chromophore in all visual pigments.},

We demonstrate that cloud computing is a viable alternative that brings long-timescale processes within reach of a broader community. We used Google's Exacycle cloud-computing platform to simulate two milliseconds of dynamics of a major drug target, the G-protein-coupled receptor Î²2AR. Markov state models aggregate independent simulations into a single statistical model that is validated by previous computational and experimental results. Moreover, our models provide an atomistic description of the activation of a G-protein-coupled receptor and reveal multiple activation pathways. Agonists and inverse agonists interact differentially with these pathways, with profound implications for drug design.},

Although physicochemical properties of DMF and DMA as solvent are similar, the Delta(t)H(o)(M(2+)) value increased significantly in the order Mn < Co < Ni < Zn. The corresponding Delta(t)H(o) values for the mono- and dichloro complexes showed also a strong metal dependence, while those for the tri- and tetrachloro complexes practically do not.

The second dimension is the solute tempering, in which the interaction between a ligand and a protein and water is weakened. The second dimension is introduced to make a ligand follow the umbrella potential more easily and enhance the binding events, which should improve the sampling efficiency. As test cases, we applied our method to two protein-ligand complex systems (MDM2 and HSP 90-alpha). Starting from the configuration in which the protein and the ligand are far away from each other in each system, our method predicted the ligand binding structures in excellent agreement with the experimental data from Protein Data Bank much faster with the improved sampling efficiency than the replica-exchange umbrella sampling method that we have previously developed.},

The average correlation between Gaussian network-model fluctuation predictions and the B-factors is 0.64 for the data set, consistent with a previous large-scale study. By separating residue interactions into covalent and noncovalent, we achieve an average correlation of 0.74, and addition of ligands and cofactors further improves the correlation to 0.75. However, further separating the noncovalent interactions into nonpolar, polar, and mixed yields no significant improvement. The addition of simple chemical information results in better prediction quality without increasing the size of the coarse-grained model.},

We use anisotropic displacement parameters from crystallography to test the quality of prediction of both the magnitude and directionality of conformational flexibility. Normal modes from four simple elastic network model potentials and from the CHARMM force field are calculated for a data set of 83 diverse, ultrahigh-resolution crystal structures. While all five potentials provide good predictions of the magnitude of flexibility, all-atom potentials have a clear edge at prediction of directionality, and the CHARMM potential has the highest prediction quality. The low-frequency modes from different potentials are similar, but those computed from the CHARMM potential show the greatest difference from the elastic network models. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the costs and benefits of using normal mode potentials of varying complexity.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel family of data-driven linear transformations, aimed at finding low-dimensional embeddings of multivariate data, in a way that optimally preserves the structure of the data. The well-studied PCA and Fisher's LDA are shown to be special members in this family of transformations, and we demonstrate how to generalize these two methods such as to enhance their performance. Furthermore, our technique is the only one, to the best of our knowledge, that reflects in the resulting embedding both the data coordinates and pairwise relationships between the data elements. Even more so, when information on the clustering (labeling) decomposition of the data is known, this information can also be integrated in the linear transformation, resulting in embeddings that clearly show the separation between the clusters, as well as their internal structure. All of this makes our technique very flexible and powerful, and lets us cope with kinds of data that other techniques fail to describe properly.},

It was shown that the electron self-exchange rate constants estimated for the Cu(dmp)(2)(2+/+) couple from the oxidation reaction of Cu(dmp)(2)(+) by Ni(tacn)(2)(3+) (5.9 x 10(2) kg mol(-1) s(-1)) and Mn(bpyO(2))(3)(3+) (2.9 x 10(4) kg mol(-1) s(-1)) were consistent with the directly measured value by NMR(5 x 10(3) kg mol(-1) s(-1)). In contrast, we obtained the electron self- exchange rate constant of Cu(dmp)(2)(2+/+) as 1.6 kg mol(-1) s(-1) from the reduction of Cu(dmp)(2)(2+) by Co(bpy)(3)(2+). The pseudo-first-order rate constant for the reduction reaction of Cu(dmp)(2)(2+) by Fe(Cp)(2) was not linear against the concentration of excess amounts of Fe(Cp)(2). A detailed analysis of the reaction revealed that the reduction of Cu(dmp)(2)(2+) involved the slow path related to the deformation of Cu(dmp)(2)(2+) (path B in Scheme 1). By using Fe(PMCp)2 (the E degrees value is 500 mV more negative than that of Fe(Cp)(2)(+/0)) as the reductant, the mixing with another pathway involving deformation of Cu(dmp)(2)(+) (path A in Scheme 1) became more evident. The origin of the 'Gated Behavior' is discussed by means of the energy differences between the 'normal' and deformed Cu(II) and Cu(I) species: the difference in the crystal field activation energies corresponding to the formation of pseudo-tetrahedral Cu(II) from tetragonally distorted Cu(II) and the difference in the stabilization energies of the tetrahedral and tetragonal Cu(I) for the activation of Cu(I) species. The reduction reaction of Cu(dmp)(2)(2+) by Fe(PMCp)(2) confirmed that the mixing of the two pathways takes place by lowering the energy level corresponding to the less favorable conformational change of Cu(I) species.},

  abstract    = {Phosphorylation of histidine-containing proteins is a key step in the mechanism of many phosphate transfer enzymes (kinases, phosphatases) and is the first stage in a wide variety of signal transduction cascades in bacteria, yeast, higher plants, and mammals. Studies of structural and dynamical aspects of such enzymes in the phosphorylated intermediate states are important for understanding the intimate molecular mechanisms of their functioning. Such information may be obtained via molecular dynamics and/or docking simulations, but in this case appropriate force field parameters for phosphohistidine should be explicitly defined. In the present article we describe development of the GROMOS96 force field parameters for phosphoimidazole molecule--a realistic model of the phosphohistidine side chain. The parameterization is based on the results of ab initio quantum chemical calculations with subsequent refinement and testing using molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics simulations. The set of force constants and equilibrium geometry is employed to derive force field for the phosphohistidine moiety. Resulting parameters and topology are incorporated into the molecular modeling package GROMACS and used in molecular dynamics simulations of a phosphohistidine-containing protein in explicit solvent.},

Electron and atomic-force microscopy indicate that rhodopsin is present as dimers in the native membranes. Here, we have expressed the protein, opsin, in COS1 cells and have studied its molecular state by using FRET and by intermolecular cross-linking after site-directed cysteine mutagenesis. To observe FRET, the ends of the genes corresponding to the N termini of the cyan or yellow fluorescent proteins were fused to the ends of the genes corresponding to the C terminus of the opsin and the resulting fused genes were expressed in COS1 cells. The emission spectra in situ of the expressed proteins were recorded, and FRET was then calculated. The result indicated intermolecular interaction between opsin molecules in COS1 cells. To identify the amino acids involved in the interaction, those predicted by molecular modeling to be at the dimer interface were mutated one at a time to cysteine, and dimer formation was measured by the rate of disulfide bond formation in the presence of cupric orthophenanthroline. The mutants W175C and Y206C formed the dimers most rapidly, showing that the two amino acids were at the dimer interface.},

  abstract             = {Abstract: Big defensin is a 79-residue peptide derived from hemocytes of the Japanese horseshoe crab. It has antimicrobial activities against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The amino acid sequence of big defensin can be divided into an N-terminal hydrophobic half and a C-terminal cationic half. Interestingly, the trypsin cleaves big defensin into two fragments, the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments, which are responsible for antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, respectively. To explore the antimicrobial mechanism of big defensin, we determined the solution structure of mature big defensin and performed a titration experiment with DPC micelles. Big defensin has a novel defensin structure; the C-terminal domain adopts a ÃÂ²-defensin structure, and the N-terminal domain forms a unique globular conformation. It is noteworthy that the hydrophobic N-terminal domain undergoes a conformational change in micelle solution, while the C-terminal domain remains unchanged. Here, we propose that the N-terminal domain achieves its antimicrobial activity in a novel fashion and explain that big defensin has developed a strategy different from those of other ÃÂ²-defensins to suppress the growth of Gram-positive bacteria.},

The dissected condensation (C) domain catalyzes the transfer of CoA-activated 3-hydroxy fatty acid with high substrate specificity at its donor site to the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) bound amino acid glutamate (Glu1).

  Abstract                 = {Acetylcholine, the first neurotransmitter to be identified, exerts many of its physiological actions via activation of a family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) known as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). Although the five mAChR subtypes (M1-M5) share a high degree of sequence homology, they show pronounced differences in G-protein coupling preference and the physiological responses they mediate. Unfortunately, despite decades of effort, no therapeutic agents endowed with clear mAChR subtype selectivity have been developed to exploit these differences. We describe here the structure of the G(q/11)-coupled M3 mAChR ('M3 receptor', from rat) bound to the bronchodilator drug tiotropium and identify the binding mode for this clinically important drug. This structure, together with that of the G(i/o)-coupled M2 receptor, offers possibilities for the design of mAChR subtype-selective ligands. Importantly, the M3 receptor structure allows a structural comparison between two members of a mammalian GPCR subfamily displaying different G-protein coupling selectivities. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations suggest that tiotropium binds transiently to an allosteric site en route to the binding pocket of both receptors. These simulations offer a structural view of an allosteric binding mode for an orthosteric GPCR ligand and provide additional opportunities for the design of ligands with different affinities or binding kinetics for different mAChR subtypes. Our findings not only offer insights into the structure and function of one of the most important GPCR families, but may also facilitate the design of improved therapeutics targeting these critical receptors.},

The neutron data for DOPC included two solvent contrasts, 50\% and 100\% D(2)O. For DPPC, additional contrast data were obtained with deuterated analogs DPPC_d62, DPPC_d13, and DPPC_d9. For the analysis, we developed a model that is based on volume probability distributions and their spatial conservation. The model's design was guided and tested by a DOPC molecular dynamics simulation. The model consistently captures the salient features found in both electron and neutron scattering density profiles. A key result of the analysis is the molecular surface area, A. For DPPC at 50 degrees C A = 63.0 A(2), whereas for DOPC at 30 degrees C A = 67.4 A(2), with estimated uncertainties of 1 A(2). Although A for DPPC agrees with a recently reported value obtained solely from the analysis of x-ray scattering data, A for DOPC is almost 10\% smaller. This improved method for determining lipid areas helps to reconcile long-standing differences in the values of lipid areas obtained from stand-alone x-ray and neutron scattering experiments and poses new challenges for molecular dynamics simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the structure of cholesterol-containing membranes composed of either short-chain (diC14:1PC) or long-chain (diC22:1PC) monounsaturated phospholipids. Bilayer structural information is derived from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, which are validated via direct comparison to x-ray scattering experiments. We show that the addition of 40 mol \% cholesterol results in a nearly identical increase in the thickness of the two different bilayers. In both cases, the chain ordering dominates over the hydrophobic matching between the length of the cholesterol molecule and the hydrocarbon thickness of the bilayer, which one would expect to cause a thinning of the diC22:1PC bilayer. For both bilayers there is substantial headgroup rearrangement for lipids directly in contact with cholesterol, supporting the so-called umbrella model. Importantly, in diC14:1PC bilayers, a dynamic network of hydrogen bonds stabilizes long-lived reorientations of some cholesterol molecules, during which they are found to lie perpendicular to the bilayer normal, deep within the bilayer's hydrophobic core. Additionally, the simulations show that the diC14:1PC bilayer is significantly more permeable to water. These differences may be correlated with faster cholesterol flip-flop between the leaflets of short-chain lipid bilayers, resulting in an asymmetric distribution of cholesterol molecules. This asymmetry was observed experimentally in a case of unilamellar vesicles (ULVs), and reproduced through a set of novel asymmetric simulations. In contrast to ULVs, experimental data for oriented multilamellar stacks does not show the asymmetry, suggesting that it results from the curvature of the ULV bilayers.},

At pH 3 we find an additional strong, short- range, monotonic, repulsive force and a long-range attractive force over a range of NaBr concentrations from 0.001M to 0.1M. Both monotonic forces are approximately exponential, with decay lengths of 0.55 and 12 nm, respectively. The short-range force is analogous to hydration forces previously measured on negatively charged surfaces. This force would provide plasticity to alumina slurries and is suggested to be the force responsible for the anomalous viscosity and consolidation behavior of alumina slurries at high salt concentrations.},

The calculated normal modes are considered individually and in linear combinations with different coefficients mimicking the phase angles between modes, in order to follow the mechanistic motions of tunnel wall residues. The low frequency fluctuations indicate three distinct regions along the tunnel-the entrance, the neck, and the exit-each having distinctly different domain motions. Generally, the lining of the entrance region moves in the exit direction, with the exit region having significantly larger motions, but in a perpendicular direction, whereas the confined neck region has rotational motions. Especially the universally conserved extensions of ribosomal proteins L4 and L22 located at the narrowest and mechanistically strategic region of tunnel undergo generally anti- or non-correlated motions, which may have an important role in nascent polypeptide gating mechanism. These motions appear to be sufficiently robust so as to be unaffected by the presence of a peptide chain in the tunnel.},

The EPR spectra reveal a remarkable similarity of rhodopsin structure and the activating conformational change in DM and bilayers, the hallmark of which is an outward tilt of transmembrane helix VI. This conformational change is blocked in solutions of digitonin, although changes in optical absorbance accompany activation, showing that absorbance and structural changes are not necessarily coupled. In DM and bilayers, the receptor is apparently in equilibrium between conformational substates whose populations are modulated by activation. Despite the general similarity in the two environments, the receptor conformations have increased flexibility in DM relative to bilayers. For the activated receptor in DM and bilayers, a pH-dependent conformational equilibrium is identified that may correspond to the optically characterized MII(a)()-MII(b)() equilibrium. No specific effects of headgroup composition on receptor conformation in lipid bilayers were found.},

  Abstract                 = {We investigate the parallel scaling of the GROMACS molecular dynamics code on Ethernet Beowulf clusters and what prerequisites are necessary for decent scaling even on such clusters with only limited bandwidth and high latency. GROMACS 3.3 scales well on supercomputers like the IBM p690 (Regatta) and on Linux clusters with a special interconnect like Myrinet or Infiniband. Because of the high single-node performance of GROMACS, however, on the widely used Ethernet switched clusters, the scaling typically breaks down when more than two computer nodes are involved, limiting the absolute speedup that can be gained to about 3 relative to a single-CPU run. With the LAM MPI implementation, the main scaling bottleneck is here identified to be the all-to-all communication which is required every time step. During such an all-to-all communication step, a huge amount of messages floods the network, and as a result many TCP packets are lost. We show that Ethernet flow control prevents network congestion and leads to substantial scaling improvements. For 16 CPUs, e.g., a speedup of 11 has been achieved. However, for more nodes this mechanism also fails. Having optimized an all-to-all routine, which sends the data in an ordered fashion, we show that it is possible to completely prevent packet loss for any number of multi-CPU nodes. Thus, the GROMACS scaling dramatically improves, even for switches that lack flow control. In addition, for the common HP ProCurve 2848 switch we find that for optimum all-to-all performance it is essential how the nodes are connected to the switch's ports. This is also demonstrated for the example of the Car-Parinello MD code.},

  abstract =    {The elucidation of structure-function relationships of membrane proteins still poses a considerable challenge due to the sometimes profound influence of the lipid bilayer on the functional properties of the protein. The visual pigment rhodopsin is a prototype of the family of G protein-coupled transmembrane receptors and a considerable part of our knowledge on its activation mechanisms has been derived from studies on detergent-solubilized proteins. This includes in particular the events associated with the conformational transitions of the receptor from the still inactive Meta I to the Meta II photoproduct states, which are involved in signaling. These events involve disruption of an internal salt bridge of the retinal protonated Schiff base, movement of helices and proton uptake from the solvent by the conserved cytoplasmic E(D)RY network around Glu134. As the equilibria associated with these events are considerably altered by the detergent environment, we set out to investigate these equilibria in the native membrane environment and to develop a coherent thermodynamic model of these activating steps using UV-visible and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy as complementary techniques. Particular emphasis is put on the role of protonation of Glu134 from the solvent, which is a thermodynamic prerequisite for full receptor activation in membranes, but not in detergent. In view of the conservation of this carboxylate group in family A G protein-coupled receptors, it may also play a similar role in the activation of other family members.},

  Abstract                 = {The visual pigment rhodopsin is a prototypical seven transmembrane helical G protein-coupled receptor. Photoisomerization of its protonated Schiff base (PSB) retinylidene chromophore initiates a progression of metastable intermediates. We studied the structural dynamics of receptor activation by FTIR spectroscopy of recombinant pigments. Formation of the active state, Meta II, is characterized by neutralization of the PSB and its counterion Glu113. We focused on testing the hypothesis of a PSB counterion switch from Glu113 to Glu181 during the transition of rhodopsin to the still inactive Meta I photointermediate. Our results, especially from studies of the E181Q mutant, support the view that both Glu113 and Glu181 are deprotonated, forming a complex counterion to the PSB in rhodopsin, and that the function of the primary counterion shifts from Glu113 to Glu181 during the transition to Meta I. The Meta I conformation in the E181Q mutant is less constrained compared with that of wild-type Meta I. In particular, the hydrogen bonded network linking transmembrane helices 1, 2, and 7, adopts a conformation that is already Meta II-like, while other parts of the receptor appear to be in a Meta I-like conformation similar to wild-type. We conclude that Glu181 is responsible, in part, for controlling the extraordinary high pK(a) of the chromophore PSB in the dark state, which very likely decreases upon transition to Meta I in a stepwise weakening of the interaction between PSB and its complex counterion during the course of receptor activation. A model for the specific role in coupling chromophore isomerization to protein conformational changes concomitant with receptor activation is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Tryptophan, proline, and basic amino acids have all been implicated as being important in the assembly and structure of membrane proteins. Indolicidin, an antimicrobial 13-residue peptide-amide isolated from the cytoplasmic granules of bovine neutrophils, is highly enriched in these amino acids: five tryptophans, three prolines, three basic residues, and no acidic residues. Consistent with the likely importance of these amino acids in membrane protein assembly, indolicidin is known to be highly membrane-active and is believed to act by disruption of cell membranes. We have, therefore, examined the interactions of native indolicidin with large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) formed from palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG), in order to use it as a model system for studying membrane protein insertion and for evaluating the relative contributions of hydrophobic and electrostatic forces in peptide-bilayer interactions. Equilibrium dialysis measurements indicate that indolicidin binds strongly, but reversibly, to both neutral POPC and anionic POPG vesicles with free energies of transfer of -8.8 +/- 0.2 and -11.5 +/- 0.4 kcal/mol, respectively. The extremely strong partitioning into POPG vesicles necessitated the development of a new equilibrium dialysis method that is described in detail. Tryptophan fluorescence measurements show that indolicidin is located in the bilayer interface and that indole fluorescence is affected by the type of lipid used to form the LUVs. Circular dichroism (CD) measurements reveal unordered conformations in aqueous and bulk organic solutions and a somewhat more ordered, but not alpha-helical, conformation in SDS micelles and lipid bilayers. Fluorescence requenching measurements (Ladokhin et al. 1995. Biophys. J. 69:1964-1971) on vesicles loaded with the fluorophore/quencher pair 8-aminonapthalene-1,3,6 trisulfonic acid (ANTS)/p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide (DPX), show that indolicidin induces membrane permeabilization. For anionic POPG, leakage is graded with a high preference for the release of cationic DPX over anionic ANTS. For neutral POPC vesicles no such preference is observed. Leakage induction is more effective with POPG vesicles than with POPC vesicles, as judged by three quantitative measures that are developed in the Appendix.},

  Abstract                 = {Indolicidin is a 13-residue antimicrobial peptide-amide isolated from the cytoplasmic granules of bovine neutrophils that contains five Trp and three Pro residues. Falla et al. [(1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 19298] suggested that indolicidin forms a poly-L-proline II helix based upon the circular dichroism (CD) spectra of a closely related peptide (indolicidin methyl ester). In contrast, we found no evidence of poly-L-proline II helix formation in the CD spectra of native indolicidin in various solvents or when bound to micelles and membranes [Ladokhin et al. (1997) Biophys. J. 72, 794]. We interpreted the spectra as arising from unordered and/or beta-turn structures, but noted a sharp negative band at 227 nm arising from the tryptophan residues that would mask spectral features characteristic of poly-L-proline II helix. We have reexamined this issue by means of CD measurements of native indolicidin and several of its analogues. None of the features characteristic of a poly-L-proline helix (or alpha- or 3(10)-helix) were observed for any of the peptides studied. To eliminate artifacts associated with tryptophan, we synthesized indolicidin-L and indolicidin-F in which all five tryptophans were replaced with leucines or phenylalanines, respectively. The changes in CD spectra of these Trp-free peptides upon transfer into membrane-like environments were found to be consistent with the formation of beta-turns. For the native indolicidin in SDS micelles, temperature increases resulted in a coupled diminution of two sharp bands, a negative one at 227 nm and a positive one at 217 nm. This phenomenon, which is absent in indolicidin-L variants with single Leu-->Trp substitutions, is consistent with exciton splitting produced by the stacking of indole rings. Type VI turns in model peptides in aqueous solution are known to be promoted by stacking interactions between cis-proline and neighboring aromatic residues [Yao et al. (1994) J. Mol. Biol. 243, 754]. Molecular modeling of indolicidin with a -Trp(6)-cis-Pro(7)-Trp(8)- type VIa turn demonstrated the feasibility of this turn conformation and revealed the possibility of an accompanying amphipathic structure. We therefore suggest that turn conformations are the principal structural motif of indolicidin and that these turns greatly enhance membrane activity.},

A striking property of MLT is that its ability to permeabilize zwitterionic phospholipid vesicles is dramatically reduced upon the addition of anionic lipids. Because the mechanism of permeabilization may be fundamentally different for the two types of lipids, we examined MLT-induced release of entrapped fluorescent dextran markers of two different molecular masses (4 and 50 kDa) from anionic palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG) vesicles. Unlike release from palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) vesicles, which is highly selective for the 4 kDa marker, implying release through pores of about 25 A diameter [Ladokhin et al., Biophys. J. 72 (1997) 1762], release from POPG vesicles was found to be non-selective, i.e., 'detergent-like'. Oriented circular dichroism measurements of MLT in oriented POPG and POPC multilayers disclosed that alpha-helical MLT can be induced to adopt a transbilayer orientation in POPC multilayers, but not in POPG multilayers. The apparent inhibition of MLT permeabilization by anionic membranes may thus be due to suppression of translocation ability.},

  Abstract                 = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are widely expressed and rapidly induced at epithelial surfaces to repel assault from diverse infectious agents including bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. Much information suggests that AMPs act by mechanisms that extend beyond their capacity to serve as gene-encoded antibiotics. For example, some AMPs alter the properties of the mammalian membrane or interact with its receptors to influence diverse cellular processes including cytokine release, chemotaxis, antigen presentation, angiogenesis and wound healing. These functions complement their antimicrobial action and favor resolution of infection and repair of damaged epithelia. Opposing this, some microbes have evolved mechanisms to inactivate or avoid AMPs and subsequently become pathogens. Thus, AMPs are multifunctional molecules that have a central role in infection and inflammation.},

  Abstract                 = {Functional dynamics of native proteins share the energy landscape that guides folding into the native state. Folding simulations of structure-based protein models, using an minimally frustrated energy landscape dominated by native interactions, can describe the geometrical aspects of the folding mechanism. Technical limitations imposed by the fixed shape of conventional contact potentials are a key obstacle toward advanced applications of structure-based models like allostery or ligand binding, which require multiple stable conformations. Generalizations of existing models, commonly using Lennard-Jones-like potentials, lead to inevitable clashes between their repulsive branches. To resolve these challenges, a new contact potential is developed that combines an attractive part based on Gaussians with a separate repulsive term allowing flexibility for adjustments of the potential shape. With this new model multiple minima for studies of functional transitions can be introduced easily and consistently. A sensitivity analysis for five small proteins confirms the robust behavior of structure-based models with our adaptable potential and explores their capacity for quantitative adjustment of the folding thermodynamics. We demonstrate its ability to incorporate alternative contact distances in simulations of structural transitions for the well-studied ROP dimer. Individual contact pairs can switch between distinct states to match the competing syn and anti structures. The flexibility of the new potential facilitates advanced uses of structure-based models. Depending on the application, features can be chosen from physical considerations or to match experiments. Generalized models can be built from multiple structures to study structural transitions or effects of disorder.},

  abstract    = {Correlated motions in biomolecules are often essential for their function, e.g., allosteric signal transduction or mechanical/thermodynamic energy transport. Because correlated motions in biomolecules remain difficult to access experimentally, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are particular useful for their analysis. The established method to quantify correlations from MD simulations via calculation of the covariance matrix, however, is restricted to linear correlations and therefore misses part of the correlations in the atomic fluctuations. Herein, we propose a general statistical mechanics approach to detect and quantify any correlated motion from MD trajectories. This generalized correlation measure is contrasted with correlations obtained from covariance matrices for the B1 domain of protein G and T4 lysozyme. The new method successfully quantifies correlations and provides a valuable global overview over the functionally relevant collective motions of lysozyme. In particular, correlated motions of helix 1 together with the two main lobes of lysozyme are detected, which are not seen by the conventional covariance matrix. Overall, the established method misses more than 50\% of the correlation. This failure is attributed to both, an interfering and unnecessary dependence on mutual orientations of the atomic fluctuations and, to a lesser extent, attributed to nonlinear correlations. Our generalized correlation measure overcomes these problems and, moreover, allows for an improved understanding of the conformational dynamics by separating linear and nonlinear contributions of the correlation.},

  abstract    = {Correlated motions in biomolecules are often essential for their function, for example, allosteric signal transduction or mechanical/thermodynamic energy transport. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a widely used method to extract functionally relevant collective motions from a molecular dynamics (MD) trajectory. Being based on the covariance matrix, however, PCA detects only linear correlations. Here we present a new method, full correlation analysis (FCA), which is based on mutual information and thus quantifies all correlations, including nonlinear and higher order correlations. For comparison, we applied both, PCA and FCA, to approximately 100 ns MD trajectories of T4 lysozyme and the hexapeptide neurotensin. For both systems, FCA yielded better resolved conformational substates and aligned its modes more often with actual transition pathways. This improved resolution is shown to be due to a strongly increased anharmonicity of FCA modes as compared to the respective PCA modes. The high anharmonicity further suggests that the motions extracted by FCA are functionally more relevant than those captured by PCA. In summary, FCA should provide improved collective degrees of freedom for dimension-reduced descriptions of macromolecular dynamics.},

Our studies focussed on the importance of the difference in the phospholipid composition of bacterial and erythrocyte membranes. This is of particular interest to gain information on the specificity of membranolysis exhibited by this peptide against bacteria but not against erythrocytes. In phosphate buffer at physiological pH, as well as in the presence of the zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin. the peptide had a random structure but it adopted an alpha-helical conformation in the presence of negatively charged lipids. Furthermore, calorimetric experiments showed that PGLa had no effects on the thermotropic phase behavior of liposomes composed of the choline phosphatides, while separation of a distinct peptide-rich domain was observed for phosphatidylglycerol liposomes. In addition to the main transition of pure 1,2-dipalmitoylglycerophosphoglycerol at 40 degrees C a second transition owing to the peptide-perturbed lipid domains was found at 41 degrees C. This conclusion is supported by X-ray diffraction experiments which indicated that PGLa penetrates into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer inducing an untilting of the hydrocarbon chains as observed in the gel phase of the pure lipid. These results demonstrate that this antibacterial peptide specifically interacts with negatively charged lipid membranes, which are characteristic of bacterial membranes. This can be explained based on the structural features of PGLa.},

  Abstract                 = {Rhodopsin is currently the only available atomic-resolution template for understanding biological functions of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family. The structural basis for the phenomenal dark state stability of 11-cis-retinal bound to rhodopsin and its ultrafast photoreaction are active topics of research. In particular, the beta-ionone ring of the retinylidene inverse agonist is crucial for the activation mechanism. We analyzed a total of 23 independent, 100 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of rhodopsin embedded in a lipid bilayer in the microcanonical (N,V,E) ensemble. Analysis of intramolecular fluctuations predicts hydrogen-out-of-plane (HOOP) wagging modes of retinal consistent with those found in Raman vibrational spectroscopy. We show that sampling and ergodicity of the ensemble of simulations are crucial for determining the distribution of conformers of retinal bound to rhodopsin. The polyene chain is rigidly locked into a single, twisted conformation, consistent with the function of retinal as an inverse agonist in the dark state. Most surprisingly, the beta-ionone ring is mobile within its binding pocket; interactions are non-specific and the cavity is sufficiently large to enable structural heterogeneity. We find that retinal occupies two distinct conformations in the dark state, contrary to most previous assumptions. The beta-ionone ring can rotate relative to the polyene chain, thereby populating both positively and negatively twisted 6-s-cis enantiomers. This result, while unexpected, strongly agrees with experimental solid-state (2)H NMR spectra. Correlation analysis identifies the residues most critical to controlling mobility of retinal; we find that Trp265 moves away from the ionone ring prior to any conformational transition. Our findings reinforce how molecular dynamics simulations can challenge conventional assumptions for interpreting experimental data, especially where existing models neglect conformational fluctuations.},

Intermolecular NOEs between hydrophobic tails of lipid and protein in the bicelles cover the surface area of OmpX forming a continuous cylindric jacket of approximately 2.7 nm in height. These NOEs originate only from DMPC molecules, and no NOEs from DHPC are observed. Further, these NOEs are mainly from methylene groups of the hydrophobic tails of DMPC, and only a handful of NOEs arise from methyl groups of the hydrophobic tails. The observed contacts indicate that the hydrophobic tails of DMPC are oriented parallel to the surface of OmpX and thus DMPC molecules form a bilayer in the vicinity of the protein. Thus, a bilayer exists in the small bicelles not only in the absence of but also in the presence of a membrane protein. In addition, the number of NOEs between the polar head groups of lipid molecules and protein is increased in the bicelles compared with those in micelles. This observation may be due to the closely packed head groups of the bilayer. Moreover, irregularity of hydrophobic interactions in the middle of the bilayer environment was observed. This observation together with the interactions between polar head groups and proteins gives a possible rationale for structural and functional differences of membrane proteins solubilized in micelles and in bilayer systems and hints at structural differences between protein-free and protein-loaded bilayers.},

The trajectories of the gold-labeled lipids were used to compute diffusion coefficients (DG) and to test for restricted motion. On the cell lamella, the gold-labeled lipids diffused freely in the plasma membrane. Since the gold must move through the pericellular matrix as the attached lipid diffuses in the plasma membrane, this result suggests that any extensive filamentous barriers in the pericellular matrix are at least 40 nm from the plasma membrane surface. The average diffusion coefficients ranged from 1.1 to 1.7 x 10(-9) cm2/s. These values were lower than the average diffusion coefficients (DF) (5.4 to 9.5 x 10(-9) cm2/s) obtained by FRAP. The lower DG is partially due to the pericellular matrix as demonstrated by the result that heparinase treatment of keratocytes significantly increased DG to 2.8 x 10(-9) cm2/s, but did not affect DF. Pericellular matrix viscosity was estimated from the frictional coefficients computed from DG and DF and ranged from 0.5 to 0.9 poise for untreated cells. Heparinase treatment of keratocytes decreased the apparent viscosity to approximately 0.1 poise. To evaluate the presence of domains or barriers, the trajectories and corresponding mean square displacement (MSD) plots of gold-labeled lipids were compared to the trajectories and MSD plots resulting from computer simulations of random walks within corrals. Based on these comparisons, we conclude that, if there are domains limiting the diffusion of F1-PE, most are larger than 5 microns in diameter.},

(J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2008, 4, 819). Membrane disruption is enhanced at higher concentrations and charge densities of both spheroidally shaped dendrimers and linear PLL polymers, in qualitatively agreement with experimental studies by Hong et al. (Bioconjugate Chem. 2006, 17, 728). However, larger molecular size enhances membrane disruption and pore formation only for dendrimers and not for the linear PLL. Despite more intimate electrostatic interactions of linear molecules than are possible for spheroidal dendrimers, only the dendrimers were found to perforate membranes, apparently because they cannot spread onto a single leaflet, and so must penetrate the bilayer to get favorable electrostatic interactions with head groups on the opposite leaflet. These results indicate that a relatively rigid spheroidal shape is more efficient than a flexible linear shape in increasing membrane permeability. These results compare favorably with experimental findings.},

  annotation = {A new optimization method is presented to search for the global minimum-energy conformations of polypeptides. The method combines essential aspects of the build-up procedure and the genetic algorithm, and it introduces the important concept of ''conformational space annealing.'' Instead of considering a single conformation, attention is focused on a population of conformations while new conformations are obtained by modifying a ''seed conformation.'' The annealing is carried out by introducing a distance cutoff, D-cut, which is defined in the conformational space; D-cut effectively divides the whole conformational space of local minima into subdivisions. The value of D is set to a large number at the beginning of the algorithm to cover the whole conformational space, and annealing is achieved by slowly reducing it. Many distinct local minima designed to be distributed as far apart as possible in conformational space are investigated simultaneously. Therefore, the new method finds not only the global minimum-energy conformation but also many other distinct local minima as by-products. The method is tested on Metenkephalin, a 24-dihedral angle problem. For all 100 independent runs, the accepted global minimum-energy conformation was obtained after about 2600 minimizations on average. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.},

  annotation = {Global optimization is playing an increasing role in physics, chemistry, and biophysical chemistry. One of the most important applications of global optimization is to find the global minima of the potential energy of molecules or molecular assemblies, such as crystals. The solution of this problem typically requires huge computational effort. Even the fastest processor available is not fast enough to carry out this kind of computation in real time for the problems of real interest, e.g., protein and crystal structure prediction. One way to circumvent this problem is to take advantage of massively parallel computing. In this paper, we provide several examples of parallel implementations of global optimization algorithms developed in our laboratory. All of these examples follow the master/worker approach. Most of the methods are parallelized on the algorithmic (coarse-grain) level and one example of fine- grain parallelism is given, in which the function evaluation itself is computationally expensive. All parallel algorithms were initially implemented on an IBM/SP2 (distributed-memory) machine. In all cases, however, message passing is handled through the standard Message Passing Interface (MPI); consequently the algorithms can also be implemented on any distributed- or shared-memory system that runs MPI. The efficiency of these implementations is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

To evaluate their relative contributions, we quantified rhodopsin, retinoids, phosphorylation, and photosensitivity in mice during a 90 min illumination followed by dark adaptation. During illumination, all-trans-retinyl esters and, to a lesser extent, all-trans-retinal accumulate and reach the steady state in <1 h. Each major phosphorylation site on rhodopsin reaches a steady state level of phosphorylation at a different time during illumination. The dominant factor that limits dark adaptation is isomerization of retinal. During dark adaptation, dephosphorylation of rhodopsin occurs in two phases. The faster phase corresponds to rapid dephosphorylation of regenerated rhodopsin present at the end of the illumination period. The slower phase corresponds to dephosphorylation of rhodopsin as it forms by regeneration. We conclude that rhodopsin phosphorylation has three physiological functions: it quenches phototransduction, reduces sensitivity during light adaptation, and suppresses bleached rhodopsin activity during dark adaptation.},

This many-body effect gives rise to the cooperative concentration dependence of peptide activities. Here we performed oriented circular dichroism and x-ray diffraction experiments to study the lipid dependence of this many-body effect. In particular we studied the correlation between lipid's spontaneous curvature and peptide's threshold concentration for pore formation by adding phosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphocholine to phosphocholine bilayers. Previously it was argued that this correlation exhibited by magainin and melittin supported the toroidal model for the pores. Here we found similar correlations exhibited by melittin and alamethicin. We found that the main effect of varying the spontaneous curvature of lipid is to change the degree of membrane thinning, which in turn influences the threshold concentration for pore formation. We discuss how to interpret the lipid dependence of membrane thinning.},

  Abstract                 = {Rhodopsin, the mammalian dim-light receptor, is one of the best-characterized G-protein-coupled receptors, a pharmaceutically important class of membrane proteins that has garnered a great deal of attention because of the recent availability of structural information. Yet the mechanism of rhodopsin activation is not fully understood. Here, we use microsecond-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, validated by solid-state (2)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, to understand the transition between the dark and metarhodopsin I (Meta I) states. Our analysis of these simulations reveals striking differences in ligand flexibility between the two states. Retinal is much more dynamic in Meta I, adopting an elongated conformation similar to that seen in the recent activelike crystal structures. Surprisingly, this elongation corresponds to both a dramatic influx of bulk water into the hydrophobic core of the protein and a concerted transition in the highly conserved Trp265(6.48) residue. In addition, enhanced ligand flexibility upon light activation provides an explanation for the different retinal orientations observed in X-ray crystal structures of active rhodopsin.},

  abstract    = {G protein-coupled receptors are vital membrane proteins that allosterically transduce biomolecular signals across the cell membrane. However, the process by which ligand binding induces protein conformation changes is not well understood biophysically. Rhodopsin, the mammalian dim-light receptor, is a unique test case for understanding these processes because of its switch-like activity; the ligand, retinal, is bound throughout the activation cycle, switching from inverse agonist to agonist after absorbing a photon. By contrast, the ligand-free opsin is outside the activation cycle and may behave differently. We find that retinal influences rhodopsin dynamics using an ensemble of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations that in aggregate contain 100 Î¼s of sampling. Active retinal destabilizes the inactive state of the receptor, whereas the active ensemble was more structurally homogenous. By contrast, simulations of an active-like receptor without retinal present were much more heterogeneous than those containing retinal. These results suggest allosteric processes are more complicated than a ligand inducing protein conformational changes or simply capturing a shifted ensemble as outlined in classic models of allostery.},

  abstract    = {Understanding the functions of biomolecules requires insight not only from structures, but from dynamics as well. Often, the most interesting processes occur on time scales too slow for exploration by conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For this reason, alternative computational methods such as elastic network models (ENMs) have become increasingly popular. These simple, coarse-grained models represent molecules as beads connected by harmonic springs; the system's motions are solved analytically by normal mode analysis. In the past few years, many different formalisms for performing ENM calculations have emerged, and several have been optimized using all-atom MD simulations. In contrast to other studies, we have compared the various formalisms in a systematic, quantitative way. In this study, we optimize many ENM functional forms using a uniform dataset containing only long (> 1 Î¼s) all-atom MD simulations. Our results show that all models once optimized produce spring constants for immediate neighboring residues that are orders of magnitude stiffer than more distal contacts. In addition, the statistical significance of ENM performance varied with model resolution. We also show that fitting long trajectories does not improve ENM performance due to a problem inherent in all network models tested: they underestimate the relative importance of the most concerted motions. Finally, we characterize ENMs' resilience by tessellating the parameter space to show that broad ranges of parameters produce similar quality predictions. Taken together our data reveals that choice of spring function and parameters are not vital to performance of a network model and that simple parameters can by derived "by hand" when no data is available for fitting, thus illustrating the robustness of these models.},

  Abstract                 = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a vital class of proteins that transduce biological signals across the cell membrane. However, their allosteric activation mechanism is not fully understood; crystal structures of active and inactive receptors have been reported, but the functional pathway between these two states remains elusive. Here, we use structure-based (GÅ-like) models to simulate activation of two GPCRs, rhodopsin and the Î²2 adrenergic receptor (Î²2 AR). We used data-derived reaction coordinates that capture the activation mechanism for both proteins, showing that activation proceeds through quantitatively different paths in the two systems. Both reaction coordinates are determined from the dominant concerted motions in the simulations so the technique is broadly applicable. There were two surprising results. First, the main structural changes in the simulations were distributed throughout the transmembrane bundle, and not localized to the obvious areas of interest, such as the intracellular portion of Helix 6. Second, the activation (and deactivation) paths were distinctly nonmonotonic, populating states that were not simply interpolations between the inactive and active structures. These transitions also suggest a functional explanation for Î²2 AR's basal activity: it can proceed through a more broadly defined path during the observed transitions. Proteins 2014.

In particular, the lysine-bound retinal has been examined, focusing on its conformation in the dark-adapted state (10 ns) and on the early steps after the isomerization of the 11-cis bond to trans (up to 10 ns). The parametrization for the chromophore is based on a recent quantum study [Sugihara, M., Buss, V., Entel, P., Elstner, M., and Frauenheim, T. (2002) Biochemistry 41, 15259Ã¢ÂÂ15266] and shows good conformational agreement with recent experimental results. The isomerization, induced by switching the function governing the dihedral angle for the C11C12 bond, was repeated with several different starting conformations. From the repeated simulations, it is shown that the retinal model exhibits a conserved activation pattern. The conformational changes are sequential and propagate outward from the C11C12 bond, starting with isomerization of the C11C12 bond, then a rotation of methyl group C20, and followed by increased fluctuations at the ÃÂ²-ionone ring. The dynamics of these changes suggest that they are linked with photointermediates observed by spectroscopy. The exact moment when these events occur after the isomerization is modulated by the starting conformation, suggesting that retinal isomerizes through multiple pathways that are slightly different. The amplitudes of the structural fluctuations observed for the protein in the dark-adapted state and after isomerization of the retinal are similar, suggesting a subtle mechanism for the transmission of information from the chromophore to the protein.},

The presence of sugars has no effect on the average spacing between the phospholipid chains in either the fluid or gel phase. Using this finding, we establish that for low sugar concentrations only a small amount of sugar exclusion occurs. Under these conditions, the effects of sugars on the membrane transition temperatures can be explained quantitatively by the reduction in hydration repulsion between bilayers due to the presence of the sugars. Specific bonding of sugars to lipid headgroups is not required to explain this effect.},

  abstract    = {Complex networks of interacting residues and microdomains in the structures of biomolecular systems underlie the reliable propagation of information from an input signal, such as the concentration of a ligand, to sites that generate the appropriate output signal, such as enzymatic activity. This information transduction often carries the signal across relatively large distances at the molecular scale in a form of allostery that is essential for the physiological functions performed by biomolecules. While allosteric behaviors have been documented from experiments and computation, the mechanism of this form of allostery proved difficult to identify at the molecular level. Here, we introduce a novel analysis framework, called N-body Information Theory (NbIT) analysis, which is based on information theory and uses measures of configurational entropy in a biomolecular system to identify microdomains and individual residues that act as (i)-channels for long-distance information sharing between functional sites, and (ii)-coordinators that organize dynamics within functional sites. Application of the new method to molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories of the occluded state of the bacterial leucine transporter LeuT identifies a channel of allosteric coupling between the functionally important intracellular gate and the substrate binding sites known to modulate it. NbIT analysis is shown also to differentiate residues involved primarily in stabilizing the functional sites, from those that contribute to allosteric couplings between sites. NbIT analysis of MD data thus reveals rigorous mechanistic elements of allostery underlying the dynamics of biomolecular systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is the gate to the nucleus. Recent determination of the configuration of proteins in the yeast NPC at approximately 5 nm resolution permits us to study the NPC global dynamics using coarse-grained structural models. We investigate these large-scale motions by using an extended elastic network model (ENM) formalism applied to several coarse-grained representations of the NPC. Two types of collective motions (global modes) are predicted by the ENMs to be intrinsically favored by the NPC architecture: global bending and extension/contraction from circular to elliptical shapes. These motions are shown to be robust against tested variations in the representation of the NPC, and are largely captured by a simple model of a toroid with axially varying mass density. We demonstrate that spoke multiplicity significantly affects the accessible number of symmetric low-energy modes of motion; the NPC-like toroidal structures composed of 8 spokes have access to highly cooperative symmetric motions that are inaccessible to toroids composed of 7 or 9 spokes. The analysis reveals modes of motion that may facilitate macromolecular transport through the NPC, consistent with previous experimental observations.},

  Abstract                 = {An all-atom local contact model is described that can be used to predict protein motions underlying isotropic crystallographic B-factors. It uses a mean-field approximation to represent the motion of an atom in a harmonic potential generated by the surrounding atoms resting at their equilibrium positions. Based on a 400-ns molecular dynamics simulation of ubiquitin in explicit water, it is found that each surrounding atom stiffens the spring constant by a term that on average scales exponentially with the interatomic distance. This model combines features of the local density model by Halle and the local contact model by Zhang and Br{\"u}schweiler. When applied to a nonredundant set of 98 ultra-high resolution protein structures, an average correlation coefficient of 0.75 is obtained for all atoms. The systematic inclusion of crystal contact contributions and fraying effects is found to enhance the performance substantially. Because the computational cost of the local contact model scales linearly with the number of protein atoms, it is applicable to proteins of any size for the prediction of B-factors of both backbone and side-chain atoms. The model performs as well as or better than several other models tested, such as rigid-body motional models, the local density model, and various forms of the elastic network model. It is concluded that at the currently achievable level of accuracy, collective intramolecular motions are not essential for the interpretation of B-factors.},

The new structure reveals mechanistically important details unresolved previously, which are considered in the membrane context by docking the structure into a cryo-electron microscopy map of 2D crystals. Kinks in the transmembrane helices facilitate inter-helical polar interactions. Ordered water molecules extend the hydrogen bonding networks, linking Trp265 in the retinal binding pocket to the NPxxY motif near the cytoplasmic boundary, and the Glu113 counterion for the protonated Schiff base to the extracellular surface. Glu113 forms a complex with a water molecule hydrogen bonded between its main chain and side-chain oxygen atoms. This can be expected to stabilise the salt-bridge with the protonated Schiff base linking the 11-cis-retinal to Lys296. The cytoplasmic ends of helices H5 and H6 have been extended by one turn. The G-protein interaction sites mapped to the cytoplasmic ends of H5 and H6 and a spiral extension of H5 are elevated above the bilayer. There is a surface cavity next to the conserved Glu134-Arg135 ion pair. The cytoplasmic loops have the highest temperature factors in the structure, indicative of their flexibility when not interacting with G protein or regulatory proteins. An ordered detergent molecule is seen wrapped around the kink in H6, stabilising the structure around the potential hinge in H6. These findings provide further explanation for the stability of the dark state structure. They support a mechanism for the activation, initiated by photo-isomerisation of the chromophore to its all-trans form, that involves pivoting movements of kinked helices, which, while maintaining hydrophobic contacts in the membrane interior, can be coupled to amplified translation of the helix ends near the membrane surfaces.},

  abstract             = {Abstract: The issue of ionizable protein side chains interacting with lipid membranes has been the focus of much attention since the proposal of the paddle model of voltage-gated ion channels, which suggested multiple arginine (Arg) side chains may move through the hydrocarbon core of a lipid membrane. Recent cell biology experiments have also been interpreted to suggest that these side chains would face only small free energy penalties to cross membranes, challenging a long-standing view in membrane biophysics. Here, we employ side chain analog and transmembrane helix models to determine the free energy of an Arg side chain, as a function of protonation state, across a membrane. We observe high free energy barriers for both the charged and neutral states that would prohibit lipid-exposed movement. The mechanisms for charged and neutral Arg transport are, however, very different, with the neutral state experiencing simple dehydration, whereas the charged state experiences a complex mechanism involving connections to the bilayer interfaces that deform the local membrane structure. We employ special methods to ensure sampling of these interfacial connections and decompose the free energy to shed light on the mechanisms. These deformations are found to preferentially stabilize the protonated form, such that the Arg side chain remains almost exclusively charged inside the membrane, with a pKa shift of d4.5 units. In contrast, the analog models are found to exaggerate the variations in energetics across the membrane and have larger pKa shifts. These results have implications for models of voltage gated ion channels, suggesting that although Arg side chains are ideally suited for carrying charge, the thermodynamics dictate that they must remain sequestered from the lipid bilayer environment.},

Yet when these side chains come into contact with membranes we do not fully understand their behavior. This is highlighted by a recent model of voltage-gated ion channel activity and translocon-based experiments that suggest small penalties to expose these side chains to lipids, opposing the prevailing view in membrane biophysics. Here we employ a side chain analog as well as a transmembrane helix model to determine the free energy as a function of protonation state and position for a lipid-exposed arginine (Arg) residue across a membrane. We observe high free energy barriers for both the charged and neutral states. Due to the stabilizing influence of membrane deformations for the protonated form, the Arg side chain experiences a pK(a) shift of <or=4.5 units and remains mostly protonated. The cost for exposing Arg to lipid hydrocarbon is prohibitively high with implications for many membrane translocating processes and the activation mechanisms of voltage-gated ion channels.},

  Abstract                 = {Antigen-antibody complexes provide useful models for studying the structure and energetics of protein-protein interactions. We report the cloning, bacterial expression, and crystallization of the antigen-binding fragment (Fab) of the anti-hen egg white lysozyme (HEL) antibody HyHEL-63 in both free and antigen-bound forms. The three-dimensional structure of Fab HyHEL-63 complexed with HEL was determined to 2.0 A resolution, while the structure of the unbound antibody was determined in two crystal forms, to 1.8 and 2.1 A resolution. In the complex, 19 HyHEL-63 residues from all six complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) of the antibody contact 21 HEL residues from three discontinuous polypeptide segments of the antigen. The interface also includes 11 bound water molecules, 3 of which are completely buried in the complex. Comparison of the structures of free and bound Fab HyHEL-63 reveals that several of the ordered water molecules in the free antibody-combining site are retained and that additional waters are added upon complex formation. The interface waters serve to increase shape and chemical complementarity by filling cavities between the interacting surfaces and by contributing to the hydrogen bonding network linking the antigen and antibody. Complementarity is further enhanced by small (<3 A) movements in the polypeptide backbones of certain antibody CDR loops, by rearrangements of side chains in the interface, and by a slight shift in the relative orientation of the V(L) and V(H) domains. The combining site residues of complexed Fab HyHEL-63 exhibit reduced temperature factors compared with those of the free Fab, suggesting a loss in conformational entropy upon binding. To probe the relative contribution of individual antigen residues to complex stabilization, single alanine substitutions were introduced in the epitope of HEL recognized by HyHEL-63, and their effects on antibody affinity were measured using surface plasmon resonance. In agreement with the crystal structure, HEL residues at the center of the interface that are buried in the complex contribute most to the binding energetics (DeltaG(mutant) - DeltaG(wild type) > 3.0 kcal/mol), whereas the apparent contributions of solvent-accessible residues at the periphery are much less pronounced (<1.5 kcal/mol). In the latter case, the mutations may be partially compensated by local rearrangements in solvent structure that help preserve shape complementarity and the interface hydrogen bonding network.},

These receptors are important drug targets, but development of subtype specific agonists and antagonists has been hampered by the lack of 3D structures for these receptors. We report here the 3D structure for the human DP G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) predicted by the MembStruk computational method. To validate this structure, we use the HierDock computational method to predict the binding mode for the endogenous agonist (PGD2) to DP. Based on our structure, we predicted the binding of different antagonists and optimized them. We find that PGD2 binds vertically to DP in the TM1237 region with the ÃÂ± chain toward the extracellular (EC) region and the ÃÂ chain toward the middle of the membrane. This structure explains the selectivity of the DP receptor and the residues involved in the predicted binding site correlate very well with available mutation experiments on DP, IP, TP, FP, and EP subtypes. We report molecular dynamics of DP in explicit lipid and water and find that the binding of the PGD2 agonist leads to correlated rotations of helices of TM3 and TM7, whereas binding of antagonist leads to no such rotations. Thus, these motions may be related to the mechanism of activation.},

This work presents a molecular construction kit that allows the easy and versatile synthesis of a broad variety of facially amphiphilic oxanorbornene-derived monomers. Their ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) and deprotection provide several series of SMAMPs. Using amphiphilicity, monomer feed ratio, and molecular weight as parameters, polymers with 533 times higher selectivitiy (selecitviy = hemolytic concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration) for bacteria over mammalian cells were discovered. Some of these polymers were 50 times more selective for Gram-positive over Gram-negative bacteria while other polymers surprisingly showed the opposite preference. This kind of double selectivity(bacteria over mammalian and one bacterial type over another) is unprecedented in other polymer systems and is attributed to the monomers facial amphiphilicity.},

Antimicrobial peptides and lipopeptides are a promising category of candidates, but the molecular origins of their antimembrane activity is unclear. Here we explore a series of recently developed antimicrobial lipopeptides, using coarse-grained molecular-dynamics simulations and free energy methods to uncover the thermodynamics governing their binding to membranes. Specifically, we quantify C16-KGGK's binding affinity to the two types of membrane by umbrella sampling. We also examined the origin of C16-KGGK's selectivity for bacterial versus mammalian membranes by systematically varying the peptide sequence and salt concentration. Our data showed that the C16 hydrophobic tail is the main contributor to its affinity to lipid membrane, whereas the peptide portion is mainly responsible for its selectivity. Furthermore, the electrostatic interaction between the cationic peptide and anionic bacterial membrane plays a significant role in the selectivity.},

  abstract =    {Antimicrobial lipopeptides (AMLPs) are antimicrobial drug candidates that preferentially target microbial membranes. One class of AMLPs, composed of cationic tetrapeptides attached to an acyl chain, have minimal inhibitory concentrations in the micromolar range against a range of bacteria and fungi. Previously, we used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and free energy methods to study the thermodynamics of their interaction with membranes in their monomeric state. Here, we extended the study to the biologically relevant micellar state, using, to our knowledge, a novel reaction coordinate based on hydrophobic contacts. Using umbrella sampling along this reaction coordinate, we identified the critical transition states when micelles insert into membranes. The results indicate that the binding of these AMLP micelles to membranes is thermodynamically favorable, but in contrast to the monomeric case, there are significant free energy barriers. The height of these free energy barriers depends on the membrane composition, suggesting that the AMLPs' ability to selectively target bacterial membranes may be as much kinetic as thermodynamic. This mechanism highlights the importance of considering oligomeric state in solution as criterion when optimizing peptides or lipopeptides as antibiotic leads.},

  abstract    = {The purpose of this study is to simulate the heat transfer problem when the 3-D Alanine tissue is heated by the gold nanoparticle in the field of molecular dynamics. In this paper, the Alanine molecule is adopted and its parameters are available in the GROMACS protein data bank. A computing algorithm is developed to evaluate the heat transfer phenomena in the nano-scale biological system based on the molecular dynamics and the protein data bank. The value of the thermal conductivity of Alanine is calculated from the autocorrelation function of the Green-Kubo formalism and this result has a roughly approximation with the bulk thermal conductivity reported by experimental data . Two kinds of problems are investigated in the paper. One is the Alanine tissue heated by the constant heat source and the other is by the time-varying heat source. The numerical results show that a temperature jump exists around the source and the temperature profiles drop to the environmental temperature within a very short distance. It concludes that only a small region around the nano-scale heat source is affected by the heated process. Therefore, the results of the nanoparticle-heated method could be applied to the clinical therapy of tumor, and the normal cells are destroyed only within a smaller region than those of chemotherapy or surgery.},

  abstract    = {Molecular dynamics simulations of membrane proteins are making rapid progress, because of new high-resolution structures, advances in computer hardware and atomistic simulation algorithms, and the recent introduction of coarse-grained models for membranes and proteins. In addition to several large ion channel simulations, recent studies have explored how individual amino acids interact with the bilayer or snorkel/anchor to the headgroup region, and it has been possible to calculate water/membrane partition free energies. This has resulted in a view of bilayers as being adaptive rather than purely hydrophobic solvents, with important implications, for example, for interaction between lipids and arginines in the charged S4 helix of voltage-gated ion channels. However, several studies indicate that the typical current simulations fall short of exhaustive sampling, and that even simple protein-membrane interactions require at least ca. 1mus to fully sample their dynamics. One new way this is being addressed is coarse-grained models that enable mesoscopic simulations on multi-mus scale. These have been used to model interactions, self-assembly and membrane perturbations induced by proteins. While they cannot replace all-atom simulations, they are a potentially useful technique for initial insertion, placement, and low-resolution refinement.},

The detailed structural interpretation of such coupling constants is usually based on Karplus relationships, which allow the measured couplings to be related to the torsion angles of the molecules. As the measured couplings are sensitive to thermal fluctuations, the parameters in the Karplus relationships are better derived from ensembles representing the distributions of dihedral angles present in solution, rather than from single conformations. We present a method to derive such parameters that uses ensembles of conformations determined through dynamic-ensemble refinement--a method that provides structural ensembles that simultaneously represent both the structure and the associated dynamics of a protein.},

The results have been used to establish donor numbers (DN(X,dce)) of anions dissolved in 1,2- dichloroethane (dce) on the same scale as that already established for solvents. Apparent donor numbers for anions dissolved in various solvents other than dce (DN(X,solv)) are also given and used to show that the donor properties of anions are directly related to the acceptor number (AN(solv)) of the solvent. This arises from competition between solvent and acceptor ion for the anion leading to a steady decrease in the effective donor number of the anion as AN(solv) increases, culminating in an effective donor number of zero for all anions in the strong acceptor solvent water (ion pairing is at a minimum in water). The values of the anion donor numbers are related to some experimental results such as spectral, equilibrium, kinetic and thermodynamic data for selected systems. This method of establishing donor numbers for anions is shown to be reliable and easy to apply.},

This remarkable theoretical result states that it is possible to obtain equilibrium thermodynamic parameters from processes carried out arbitrarily far from equilibrium. We test Jarzynski's equality by mechanically stretching a single molecule of RNA reversibly and irreversibly between two conformations. Application of this equality to the irreversible work trajectories recovers the DeltaG profile of the stretching process to within k(B)T/2 (half the thermal energy) of its best independent estimate, the mean work of reversible stretching. The implementation and test of Jarzynski's equality provides the first example of its use as a bridge between the statistical mechanics of equilibrium and nonequilibrium systems. This work also extends the thermodynamic analysis of single molecule manipulation data beyond the context of equilibrium experiments.},

Encoded by the ABCG2 gene, overexpression confers resistance to camptothecins, as well as to mitoxantrone. We developed four polyclonal antibodies against peptides corresponding to four different epitopes on the mitoxantrone resistance-associated protein, ABCG2. Three epitopes localized on the cytoplasmic region of ABCG2 gave rise to high-affinity antibodies, which were demonstrated to be specific for ABCG2. Western blot analysis of cells with high levels of ABCG2 showed a single major band of the expected 72-kDa molecular size of ABCG2 under denaturing conditions. Immunoblot analysis performed under non-reducing conditions and after treatment with cross-linking reagents demonstrated a molecular weight shift from 72 kDa to several bands of 180 kDa and higher molecular weight, suggesting detection of dimerization products of ABCG2. Evidence of N-linked glycosylation was also obtained using tunicamycin and N-glycosidase F. Finally, both by light, fluorescence and electron microscopic immunohistochemical staining, we demonstrate cytoplasmic and predominantly plasma membrane localization of ABCG2 in cell lines with high levels of expression. Plasma membrane staining was observed on the surface of the chorionic villi in placenta. These results support the hypothesis that ABCG2 is an ABC half-transporter that forms dimers in the plasma membrane, functioning as an ATP-dependent outward pump for substrate transport.},

We have identified a potential class of latent antibiotics, the arylomycins, which are lipopeptides with a C-terminal macrocycle that target signal peptidase and whose spectrum is limited by a resistance-conferring mutation in many bacteria. Herein, we report the synthesis and evaluation of several arylomycin derivatives, and demonstrate that both C-terminal homologation with a glycyl aldehyde and addition of a positive charge to the macrocycle increase the activity and spectrum of the arylomycin scaffold.},

  Abstract                 = {Human UBC9 is a member of the E2 (ubiquitin conjugation enzyme) family of proteins. Instead of conjugating to ubiquitin, it conjugates with a ubiquitin homologue UBL1 (also known as SUMO-1, GMP1, SMTP3, PIC1, and sentrin). UBC9 has been shown to be involved in cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and p53-dependent processes. The binding interfaces of the UBC9 and UBL1 complex have been determined by chemical shift perturbation using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The binding site of UBL1 resides on the ubiquitin domain, and the binding site of UBC9 is located on a structurally conserved region of E2. Because the UBC9-UBL1 system shares many similarities with the ubiquitin system in structures and in conjugation with each other and with target proteins, the observed binding interfaces may be conserved in E2-ubiquitin interactions in general.},

Structural studies of such effects have been limited due to the medium resolution of GPCR structures. We reengineered the human A(2A) adenosine receptor by replacing its third intracellular loop with apocytochrome b(562)RIL and solved the structure at 1.8 angstrom resolution. The high-resolution structure allowed us to identify 57 ordered water molecules inside the receptor comprising three major clusters. The central cluster harbors a putative sodium ion bound to the highly conserved aspartate residue Asp(2.50). Additionally, two cholesterols stabilize the conformation of helix VI, and one of 23 ordered lipids intercalates inside the ligand-binding pocket. These high-resolution details shed light on the potential role of structured water molecules, sodium ions, and lipids/cholesterol in GPCR stabilization and function.},

  Abstract                 = {The ATPase cycle of the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) is largely dependent on the ability of its nucleotide binding domain (NBD), also called ATPase domain, to undergo structural changes between its open and closed conformations. We present here a combined study of the Hsp70 NBD sequence, structure and dynamic features to identify the residues that play a crucial role in mediating the allosteric signaling properties of the ATPase domain. Specifically, we identify the residues involved in the shortest-path communications of the domain modeled as a network of nodes (residues) and links (equilibrium interactions). By comparing the calculations on both closed and open conformation of Hsp70 NBD, we identified a subset of central residues located at the interface between the two lobes of the NBD near the nucleotide binding site, which form a putative communication pathway invariant to structural changes. Two pairs of residues forming contacts at the interface in the closed conformation of the NBD are observed to no longer interact in the open conformation, suggesting that these specific interactions may play a switch role in establishing the transition of the NBD between the two functional forms. Sequence co-evolution analysis and collective dynamics analysis with elastic network model further confirm the key roles of these residues in Hsp70 NBD dynamics and functions.},

Four immobilization approaches of seven different methods include: (i) physical adsorption; (ii) two thioamine thiolation methods, using cysteamine and cystamine for gold chemisorption and further coupling; (iii) two oxidized dextran spacer methods, coupling of cysteamine and cystamine thiolated QCM surface with periodate-oxidized dextran for further Schiff acid-base reaction; and (iv) two thiol-gold chemisorption-based self-assembled monolayer (SAM), applying short-chain, C(3), and long-chain, C(11), mercapto fatty acids to insolubilize human serum albumin (HSA) on QCM surface. Effects of these protein immobilization methods on FIA immunoassay of anti-HSA were compared. At the 0.01 mg/ml anti-HSA level, the lowest analyte concentration tested, the SAM using 11-mercaptoundecanoic acid as QCM surface activating agent generated a larger frequency shift than the other immobilization methods. This implied that the use of thiolated long-chain fatty acid constructed as self-assembled monolayer may thereby potentially be a useful protein immobilization method in QCM-FIA application.},

Whereas C(12)K-3beta(10) exerted an essentially bactericidal effect, E. coli bacteria were killed faster than S. aureus (minutes versus hours). Mechanistic studies addressing this difference revealed that unlike E. coli, S. aureus bacteria undergo a transient rapid bactericidal stage that over time converts to a bacteriostatic effect. This behavior was dictated by interactions with cell wall-specific components. Preliminary efficacy studies in mice using the thigh infection model demonstrated the OAK's ability to significantly affect bacterial viability upon single-dose systemic treatment (2 mg/kg).},

  Abstract                 = {Interest in biophysical studies on the interaction of antimicrobial peptides and lipids has strongly increased because of the rapid emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. An understanding of the molecular mechanism(s) of membrane perturbation by these peptides will allow a design of novel peptide antibiotics as an alternative to conventional antibiotics. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction studies have yielded a wealth of quantitative information on the effects of antimicrobial peptides on membrane structure as well as on peptide location. These studies clearly demonstrated that antimicrobial peptides show preferential interaction with specific phospholipid classes. Furthermore, they revealed that in addition to charge-charge interactions, membrane curvature strain and hydrophobic mismatch between peptides and lipids are important parameters in determining the mechanism of membrane perturbation. Hence, depending on the molecular properties of both lipid and peptide, creation of bilayer defects such as phase separation or membrane thinning, pore formation, promotion of nonlamellar lipid structures or bilayer disruption by the carpet model or detergent-like action, may occur. Moreover, these studies suggest that these different processes may represent gradual steps of membrane perturbation. A better understanding of the mutual dependence of these parameters will help to elucidate the molecular mechanism of membrane damage by antimicrobial peptides and their target membrane specificity, keys for the rationale design of novel types of peptide antibiotics.},

Here the hypersingular integral technique is used in a boundary element method (BEM) for the three-dimensional (3D) linear PBE to calculate the Maxwell stress tensor on the solvated molecular surface, and then the PB forces and torques can be obtained from the stress tensor. Compared with the variational method (also in a BEM frame) that we proposed recently, this method provides an even more efficient way to calculate the full intermolecular electrostatic interaction force, especially for macromolecular systems. Thus, it may be more suitable for the application of Brownian dynamics methods to study the dynamics of protein/protein docking as well as the assembly of large 3D architectures involving many diffusing subunits. The method has been tested on two simple cases to demonstrate its reliability and efficiency, and also compared with our previous variational method used in BEM.},

  abstract =             {The adsorption of a series of cationic lipopeptide surfactants, C14Kn (where C14 denotes the myristic acyl chain and Kn represents n number of lysine residuals) at the hydrophobic solid/water interface has been studied using spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) and neutron reflection (NR). The hydrophobic C8 surface was prepared by grafting a monolayer of octyltrimethoxysilane on the silicon surface. SE was used to follow the dynamic adsorption from these lipopeptide surfactants and the amount was found to undergo fast increase within the first 2-3 min, followed by a much slow process tending to equilibration in the subsequent 15-20 min. Lipopetide surfactants with n = 1-4 showed similar dynamic feature, indicating that the interaction between the acyl chain and the C8 surface is the main driving force for adsorption. The saturation adsorption amount of C14Kn at the C8/water interface was found to be inversely related to the increasing number of Lys residues in the head group due to the increase of steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion between the head groups. Solution concentration had a significant effect on the initial adsorption rate, similar to the feature observed from nonionic surfactants CmEn. The structure of the adsorbed layers was studied by NR in conjunction with isotopic contrasts. The layer formed by the head groups of C14K1 was 10 A thick, and those formed by C14K2, C14K3 and C14K4 head groups were all about 13 A thick. In contrast, the thicknesses of the layers formed by hydrophobic tails of C14K1, C14K2 C14K3, and C14K4 were found to be 17 A, 13 A, 10 A, and 10 A, respectively, resulting in the steady incease of area per molecule at the interface from 29+/-2 A2 for C14K1 to 65+/-2 A2 for C14K4. Thus, with increase in the head group length, the molecules in the adsorbed layer tended to lie down upon adsorption.},

The method does not require any additional adjustable parameters after coarse graining and is computationally very fast. Tests on modeling the experimentally measured anisotropic displacement parameters in biomolecular x-ray crystallography demonstrate that the method can consistently perform better than other commonly used methods including our own one.

  Abstract                 = {A challenge in free energy calculation for complex molecular systems by computer simulation is to obtain a reliable estimate within feasible computational time. In this study, we suggest an answer to this challenge by exploring a simple method, overlap sampling (OS), for producing reliable free-energy results in an efficient way. The formalism of the OS method is based on ensuring sampling of important overlapping phase space during perturbation calculations. This technique samples both forward and reverse free energy perturbation (FEP) to improve the free-energy calculation. It considers the asymmetry of the FEP calculation and features an ability to optimize both the precision and the accuracy of the measurement without affecting the simulation process itself. The OS method is tested at two optimization levels: no optimization (simple OS), and full optimization (equivalent to Bennett's method), and compared to conventional FEP techniques, including the widely used direct FEP averaging method, on three alchemical mutation systems: (a) an anion transformation in water solution, (b) mutation between methanol and ethane, and (c) alchemical change of an adenosine molecule. It is consistently shown that the reliability of free-energy estimates can be greatly improved using the OS techniques at both optimization levels, while the performance of Bennett's method is particularly striking. In addition, the efficiency of a calculation can be significantly improved because the method is able to (a) converge to the right answer quickly, and (b) work for large perturbations. The basic two-stage OS method can be extended to admit additional stages, if needed. We suggest that the OS method can be used as a general perturbation technique for computing free energy differences in molecular simulations. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}

In this study we examine the utility of computing alchemical free energy changes using overlap perturbation techniques. These techniques include both the overlap histogram method and the overlap sampling method (a fully optimized version of the overlap sampling technique is equivalent to Bennett's method), and commonly combine sets of perturbations from both alchemical states of interest to improve a free energy calculation. In addition, we propose new variants, present generalized formulas for overlap perturbation techniques and demonstrate differences from the prevailing direct averaging approach used in alchemical free energy calculations. These overlap perturbation methods can be applied to either equilibrium or non-equilibrium free energy simulations. The alchemical transformation of an adenosine molecule in aqueous solution is used as an example for evaluating these techniques. The calculations show that the methods are capable of producing excellent free energy estimates for an extended range of perturbation magnitudes. We suggest that these overlap perturbation methods should be more widely used for the computation of alchemical free energy changes in biomolecular simulations.}

  Abstract                 = {Membrane protein function is regulated by the host lipid bilayer composition. This regulation may depend on specific chemical interactions between proteins and individual molecules in the bilayer, as well as on non-specific interactions between proteins and the bilayer behaving as a physical entity with collective physical properties (e.g. thickness, intrinsic monolayer curvature or elastic moduli). Studies in physico-chemical model systems have demonstrated that changes in bilayer physical properties can regulate membrane protein function by altering the energetic cost of the bilayer deformation associated with a protein conformational change. This type of regulation is well characterized, and its mechanistic elucidation is an interdisciplinary field bordering on physics, chemistry and biology. Changes in lipid composition that alter bilayer physical properties (including cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids, other lipid metabolites and amphiphiles) regulate a wide range of membrane proteins in a seemingly non-specific manner. The commonality of the changes in protein function suggests an underlying physical mechanism, and recent studies show that at least some of the changes are caused by altered bilayer physical properties. This advance is because of the introduction of new tools for studying lipid bilayer regulation of protein function. The present review provides an introduction to the regulation of membrane protein function by the bilayer physical properties. We further describe the use of gramicidin channels as molecular force probes for studying this mechanism, with a unique ability to discriminate between consequences of changes in monolayer curvature and bilayer elastic moduli.},

  Abstract                 = {Many drugs are amphiphiles that, in addition to binding to a particular target protein, adsorb to cell membrane lipid bilayers and alter intrinsic bilayer physical properties (e.g., bilayer thickness, monolayer curvature, and elastic moduli). Such changes can modulate membrane protein function by altering the energetic cost (DeltaG(bilayer)) of bilayer deformations associated with protein conformational changes that involve the protein-bilayer interface. But amphiphiles have complex effects on the physical properties of lipid bilayers, meaning that the net change in DeltaG(bilayer) cannot be predicted from measurements of isolated changes in such properties. Thus, the bilayer contribution to the promiscuous regulation of membrane proteins by drugs and other amphiphiles remains unknown. To overcome this problem, we use gramicidin A (gA) channels as molecular force probes to measure the net effect of amphiphiles, at concentrations often used in biological research, on the bilayer elastic response to a change in the hydrophobic length of an embedded protein. The effects of structurally diverse amphiphiles can be described by changes in a phenomenological bilayer spring constant (H(B)) that summarizes the bilayer elastic properties, as sensed by a bilayer-spanning protein. Amphiphile-induced changes in H(B), measured using gA channels of a particular length, quantitatively predict changes in lifetime for channels of a different length--as well as changes in the inactivation of voltage-dependent sodium channels in living cells. The use of gA channels as molecular force probes provides a tool for quantitative, predictive studies of bilayer-mediated regulation of membrane protein function by amphiphiles.},

  Abstract                 = {G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent the family of proteins with the highest impact from social, therapeutic and economic point of view. Today, more than 50\% of drug targets are based on GPCRs and the annual worldwide sales exceeds 50 billion dollars. GPCRs are involved in all major disease areas such as cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodegenerative, psychiatric, cancer and infectious diseases. The classical drug discovery process has relied on screening compounds, which interact favorably with the GPCR of interest followed by further chemical engineering as a mean of improving efficacy and selectivity. In this review, methods for sophisticated chemical library screening procedures will be presented. Furthermore, development of cell-based assays for functional coupling of GPCRs to G proteins will be discussed. Finally, the possibility of applying structure-based drug design will be summarized. This includes the application of bioinformatics knowledge and molecular modeling approaches in drug development programs. The major efforts established through large networks of structural genomics on GPCRs, where recombinantly expressed GPCRs are subjected to purification and crystallization attempts with the intention of obtaining high-resolution structures, are presented as a promising future approach for tailor-made drug development.},

We directly observe that the effect of cholesterol binding is to stabilize helix II against a buckling-type deformation, perhaps rationalizing the observation that the A(2A) receptor couples to G protein only in the presence of cholesterol (Zezula and Freissmuth, 2008). The results suggest a mechanism by which the A(2A) receptor may function as a coincidence detector, activating only in the presence of both cholesterol and agonist. We also observed a previously hypothesized conformation of the tryptophan "rotameric switch" on helix VI in which a phenylalanine on helix V positions the tryptophan out of the ligand binding pocket.},

The method is simple and applicable to models at any level of coarse-graining. We validated the method in three systems. First, we computed the persistence length of ADP-bound F-actin, using a heteroENM model. The value of 6.1 +/- 1.6 microm is consistent with the experimentally measured value of 9.0 +/- 0.5 microm. We then compared our method to a uniform elastic network model and a realistic extension algorithm via covariance Hessian (REACH) model of carboxy myoglobin, and found that the heteroENM method more accurately predicted mean-square fluctuations of alpha-carbon atoms. Finally, we showed that the method captures critical differences in effective harmonic interactions for coarse-grained models of the N-terminal Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (N-BAR) domain of amphiphysin, by building models of N-BAR both bound to a membrane and free in solution.},

Our approach reports directly and systematically on the structural diversity of a simulation trajectory. Straightforward clustering and classification steps are the key ingredients, allowing the approach to be trivially applied to systems of any size. Our initial study on met-enkephalin strongly suggests that even fairly long trajectories (approximately 50 ns) may not be converged for this small--but highly flexible--system.},

Such assessment is critical not only for establishing the relevance of any individual simulation but also in the extremely active field of developing computational methods. Here we map the trajectory assessment problem onto a simple statistical calculation of the "effective sample size", that is, the number of statistically independent configurations. The mapping is achieved by asking the question, "How much time must elapse between snapshots included in a sample for that sample to exhibit the statistical properties expected for independent and identically distributed configurations?" Our method is more general than autocorrelation methods in that it directly probes the configuration-space distribution without requiring a priori definition of configurational substates and without any fitting parameters. We show that the method is equally and directly applicable to toy models, peptides, and a 72-residue protein model. Variants of our approach can readily be applied to a wide range of physical and chemical systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The phytopathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae produces toxic cyclic lipodepsipeptides (CLPs): nona-peptides and syringopeptins. All CLPs inhibit the growth of many fungal species, including human pathogens, although different fungi display different degrees of sensitivity. The best studied CLPs are Syringomycin-E (SR-E), Syringotoxin-B (ST-B) and Syringopeptin-25A (SP-25A). Their biological activity is affected by membrane composition and their structural differences. We previously (Matyus et al. in Eur Biophys J 35:459-467, 2006) reported the molecular features and structural preferences of SR-E in water and octane environments. Here we investigate in atomic detail the molecular features of the two other main CLP components, ST-B and SP-25A, in water and octane by 200 ns molecular dynamics simulations (MD), using distance restraints derived from NMR NOE data (Ballio et al. in Eur J Biochem 234:747-758, 1995). We have obtained three-dimensional models of ST-B and SP-25A CLPs in different environments. These models can now be used as a basis to investigate the interactions of ST-B and SP-25A with lipid membranes an important further step towards a better understanding of the antifungal and antibacterial activity of these peptides.},

The old dogma is that a one ligand/one receptor complex constitutes the functional unit of GPCR signaling. However, there is mounting evidence that some GPCRs form dimers or oligomers during their biosynthesis, activation, inactivation, and/or internalization. This evidence has been obtained exclusively from cell culture experiments, and proof for the physiological significance of GPCR di/oligomerization in vivo is still missing. Using the mouse luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) as a model GPCR, we demonstrate that transgenic mice coexpressing binding-deficient and signaling-deficient forms of LHR can reestablish normal LH actions through intermolecular functional complementation of the mutant receptors in the absence of functional wild-type receptors. These results provide compelling in vivo evidence for the physiological relevance of intermolecular cooperation in GPCR signaling.},

  Abstract                 = {Efficient protein folding implies a microscopic funnel-like multidimensional free-energy landscape. Macroscopically, conformational entropy reduction can manifest itself as part of an empirical barrier in the traditional view of folding, but experiments show that such barriers can also entail significant unfavorable enthalpy changes. This observation raises the puzzling possibility, irrespective of conformational entropy, that individual microscopic folding trajectories may encounter large uphill moves and thus the multidimensional free-energy landscape may not be funnel-like. Here, we investigate how nanoscale hydrophobic interactions might underpin this salient enthalpic effect in biomolecular assembly by computer simulations of the association of two preformed polyalanine or polyleucine helices in water. We observe a high, positive enthalpic signature at room temperature when the helix separation is less than a single layer of water molecules. Remarkably, this unfavorable enthalpy change, with a parallel increase in void volume, is largely compensated for by a concomitant increase in solvent entropy, netting only a small or nonexistent microscopic free-energy barrier. Thus, our findings suggest that high enthalpic folding barriers can be consistent with a funnel picture of folding and are mainly a desolvation phenomenon indicative of a cooperative mechanism of simultaneous formation of multiple side-chain contacts at the rate-limiting step.},

  abstract        = {Diverse molecules induce general anesthesia with potency strongly correlated with both their hydrophobicity and their effects on certain ion channels. We recently observed that several n-alcohol anesthetics inhibit heterogeneity in plasma-membrane-derived vesicles by lowering the critical temperature (Tc) for phase separation. Here, we exploit conditions that stabilize membrane heterogeneity to further test the correlation between the anesthetic potency of n-alcohols and effects on Tc. First, we show that hexadecanol acts oppositely to n-alcohol anesthetics on membrane mixing and antagonizes ethanol-induced anesthesia in a tadpole behavioral assay. Second, we show that two previously described "intoxication reversers" raise Tc and counter ethanol's effects in vesicles, mimicking the findings of previous electrophysiological and behavioral measurements. Third, we find that elevated hydrostatic pressure, long known to reverse anesthesia, also raises Tc in vesicles with a magnitude that counters the effect of butanol at relevant concentrations and pressures. Taken together, these results demonstrate that ÎTc predicts anesthetic potency for n-alcohols better than hydrophobicity in a range of contexts, supporting a mechanistic role for membrane heterogeneity in general anesthesia.},

  Abstract                 = {Computational studies of proteins based on empirical force fields represent a powerful tool to obtain structure-function relationships at an atomic level, and are central in current efforts to solve the protein folding problem. The results from studies applying these tools are, however, dependent on the quality of the force fields used. In particular, accurate treatment of the peptide backbone is crucial to achieve representative conformational distributions in simulation studies. To improve the treatment of the peptide backbone, quantum mechanical (QM) and molecular mechanical (MM) calculations were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline dipeptides, and the results from these calculations were combined with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins in crystal and aqueous environments. QM potential energy maps of the alanine and glycine dipeptides at the LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G* levels, where x = D, T, and Q, were determined, and are compared to available QM studies on these molecules. The LMP2/cc-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G* energy surfaces for all three dipeptides were then used to improve the MM treatment of the dipeptides. These improvements included additional parameter optimization via Monte Carlo simulated annealing and extension of the potential energy function to contain peptide backbone phi, psi dihedral crossterms or a phi, psi grid-based energy correction term. Simultaneously, MD simulations of up to seven proteins in their crystalline environments were used to validate the force field enhancements. Comparison with QM and crystallographic data showed that an additional optimization of the phi, psi dihedral parameters along with the grid-based energy correction were required to yield significant improvements over the CHARMM22 force field. However, systematic deviations in the treatment of phi and psi in the helical and sheet regions were evident. Accordingly, empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based energy correction for alanine and glycine to account for these systematic differences. These adjustments lead to greater deviations from QM data for the two dipeptides but also yielded improved agreement with experimental crystallographic data. These improvements enhance the quality of the CHARMM force field in treating proteins. This extension of the potential energy function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment of biological macromolecules via MM approaches in general.},

  Abstract                 = {Empirical force field-based calculations of proteins, including protein-folding studies, have improved our understanding of the relationship of their structure to their biological function. However, limitations in the accuracy of empirical force fields in the treatment of the peptide backbone exist. Presented is a grid correction approach to improve the treatment of the peptide backbone phi/psi conformational energies. Inclusion of this correction with the CHARMM22 all-atom protein force field is shown to lead to significant improvement in the treatment of the conformational energies of both the peptide model compound, the alanine dipeptide, and of proteins in their crystal environment. The developed approach is suggested to lead to significant improvements in the accuracy of empirical force fields to treat peptides and proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation mediated by ligand-induced structural reorganization of its helices is poorly understood. To determine the universal elements of this conformational switch, we used evolutionary tracing (ET) to identify residue positions commonly important in diverse GPCRs. When mapped onto the rhodopsin structure, these trace residues cluster into a network of contacts from the retinal binding site to the G protein-coupling loops. Their roles in a generic transduction mechanism were verified by 211 of 239 published mutations that caused functional defects. When grouped according to the nature of the defects, these residues sub-divided into three striking sub-clusters: a trigger region, where mutations mostly affect ligand binding, a coupling region near the cytoplasmic interface to the G protein, where mutations affect G protein activation, and a linking core in between where mutations cause constitutive activity and other defects. Differential ET analysis of the opsin family revealed an additional set of opsin-specific residues, several of which form part of the retinal binding pocket, and are known to cause functional defects upon mutation. To test the predictive power of ET, we introduced novel mutations in bovine rhodopsin at a globally important position, Leu-79, and at an opsin-specific position, Trp-175. Both were functionally critical, causing constitutive G protein activation of the mutants and rapid loss of regeneration after photobleaching. These results define in GPCRs a canonical signal transduction mechanism where ligand binding induces conformational changes propagated through adjacent trigger, linking core, and coupling regions.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation of the tetramer model of a GPCR other than rhodopsin. The model consists of three inactive and one active V2R monomers. The activated unit is stabilized by GsÃÂ± (Ile382-Leu394) fragment and includes its natural ligand Ã¢ÂÂ vasopressin (AVP) docked. The pairs of neighboring protomers form contact dimers with the interface created by transmembrane helices TM3, TM4 of one partner and TM7, TM6 of the other. The between-dimers interface is composed by TM5 and TM4 of all monomers. Since experimental studies of GPCR oligomerization are not generally possible, there is a strong interest in using theoretical methods to predict their structure. Herein the NAnoscale Molecular Dynamics (NAMD) 2.6 package and CHARMm force field were used to conduct unconstrained MD calculations in periodic conditions. The optimal adjusting of monomers in lipid membrane surrounding was the purpose of simulation. Residues responsible for the oligomer stabilization were suggested and a compatibility of the whole model with available experimental data was discussed.},

This is particularly true for the agonist conformation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), where it is thought that the movement of helices that occurs upon agonist binding results in a looser and less stable packing in the protein. Here, we show that mutagenesis coupled to a specific selection strategy can be used to stabilize the agonist and antagonist conformations of the adenosine A2a receptor. Of the 27 mutations identified that improve the thermostability of the agonist conformation, only three are also present in the 17 mutations identified that improve the thermostability of the antagonist conformation, suggesting that the selection strategies used were specific for each conformation. Combination of the stabilizing mutations for the antagonist- or agonist-binding conformations resulted in mutants that are more stable at higher temperatures than the wild-type receptor by 17ÃÂ°C and 9ÃÂ°C, respectively. The mutant receptors both showed markedly improved stability in short-chain alkyl-glucoside detergents compared with the wild-type receptor, which will facilitate their structural analysis.},

The first switch involves disruption of an interhelical salt bridge by internal proton transfer from the retinal protonated Schiff base (PSB) to its counterion, Glu-113, in the transmembrane domain. The second switch consists of uptake of a proton from the solvent by Glu-134 of the conserved E(D)RY motif at the cytoplasmic terminus of helix 3, leading to pH-dependent receptor activation. By using a combination of UV-visible and FTIR spectroscopy, we study the activation mechanism of rhodopsin in different membrane environments and show that these 2 protonation switches become partially uncoupled at physiological temperature. This partial uncoupling leads to 50\% population of an entropy-stabilized Meta II state in which the interhelical PSB salt bridge is broken and activating helix movements have taken place but in which Glu-134 remains unprotonated. This partial activation is converted to full activation only by coupling to the pH-dependent protonation of Glu-134 from the solvent, which stabilizes the active receptor conformation by lowering its enthalpy. In a membrane environment, protonation of Glu-134 is therefore a thermodynamic rather than a structural prerequisite for activating helix movements. In light of the conservation of the E(D)RY motif in rhodopsin-like GPCRs, protonation of this carboxylate also may serve a similar function in signal transduction of other members of this receptor family.},

  Abstract                 = {Temporins constitute a family of amphipathic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides (AMP) and contain some of the shortest cytotoxic peptides, comprised of only 10-14 residues. General characteristics of temporins parallel those of other AMP, both in terms of structural features and biophysical properties relating to their interactions with membrane lipids, with selective lipid-binding properties believed to underlie the discrimination between target vs host cells. Lipid-binding properties also contribute to the cytotoxicity AMP, causing permeabilization of their target cell membranes. The latter functional property of AMP involves highly interdependent acidic phospholipid-induced conformational changes, aggregation, and formation of toxic oligomers in the membrane. These oligomers are subsequently converted to amyloid-type fibers, as demonstrated for e.g. temporins B and L in our laboratory, and more recently for dermaseptins by Auvynet et al. Amyloid state represents the generic minimum in the folding/aggregation free energy landscape, and for AMP its formation most likely serves to detoxify the peptides, in keeping with the current consensus on mature amyloid being inert and non-toxic. The above scenario is supported by sequence analyses of temporins as well as other amphipathic alpha-helical AMP belonging to diverse families. Accordingly, sequence comparison identifies 'conformational switches', domains with equal probabilities for adopting random coil, alpha-helical and beta-sheet structures. These regions were further predicted also to aggregate and assemble into amyloid beta-sheets. Taken together, the lipid-binding properties and structural characterization lend support to the notion that the mechanism of membrane permeabilization by temporins B and L and perhaps of most AMP could be very similar, if not identical, to that of the paradigm amyloid forming cytotoxic peptides, responsible for degenerative cell loss in e.g. prion, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, and type 2 diabetes.},

The result is the five-site TIP5P model, which yields significantly improved results; the average error in the density over the 100 degrees temperature range from -37.5 to 62.5 degrees C at 1 atm is only 0.006 g cm(-3). Classical Monte Carlo statistical mechanics calculations have been performed to optimize the parameters, especially the position of the negative charges along the lone- pair directions. Initial calculations with 216 molecules in the NPT ensemble at 1 atm focused on finding a model that reproduced the shape of the liquid density curve as a function of temperature. Calculations performed for 512 molecules with the final TIP5P model demonstrate that the density maximum near 4 degrees C at 1 atm is reproduced, while high-quality structural and thermodynamic results are maintained. Attainment of high precision for the low-temperature runs required sampling for more than 1 billion Monte Carlo configurations. In addition, the dielectric constant was computed from the response to an applied electric field; the result is 81.5 +/- 1.5 at 25 degrees C and the experimental curve is mirrored from 0-100 degrees C at 1 atm. The TIP5P model is also found to perform well as a function of pressure; the density of liquid water at 25 degrees C is reproduced with an average error of similar to 2\% over the range from 1 to 10 000 atm, and the shift of the temperature of maximum density to lower temperature with increasing pressure is also obtained.

Here we report the following. (i) The attachment of an aliphatic chain to otherwise inert, cationic D,L tetrapeptides endows them with potent activity against various microorganisms including antibiotic resistance strains. (ii) Cell specificity is determined by the sequence of the short peptidic chain and the length of the aliphatic moiety. (iii) Despite the fact that the peptidic chains are very short, their mode of action involves permeation and disintegration of membranes, similar to that of many long antimicrobial peptides. Besides adding important information on the parameters necessary for host-defense lipopeptides to kill microorganisms, the simple composition of these lipopeptides and their diverse specificities should make them economically available, innate immunity-mimicking antimicrobial and antifungal compounds for various applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Antimicrobial peptides and lipopeptides play an essential protective role in the innate immune system of all organisms. Despite many studies, the factors that dictate their cell-selectivity and pH-dependent activity are yet not clear. This is important because various organs of the human body have an acidic pH environment, for example, the vagina, gastric lumen, cryogenic dental foci, and lung-lining fluids in cystic fibrosis and asthma. In this study we synthesized a new group of lipopeptides by conjugating dodecanoic acid (DDA) to the N-termini of 12-mer peptides LXXLLXXLLXXL (L(6)X(6), X = Lys, His, Arg, and all the leucines are d-amino acid enantiomers) and investigated their pH-dependent biological activity and a plausible mode of action by using model phospholipids mimicking bacterial, mammalian, and fungal membranes. The data revealed that, depending on the basic amino acid incorporated, the lipopeptides are active against both bacteria and fungi or solely toward fungi. Furthermore, their activity is expressed at an acidic pH alone, neutral pH alone, or at both environments. Determination of secondary structure, membrane leakage experiments, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) binding experiments, and transmission electron microscopy suggest the involvement of a membranolytic effect. This mode of action, which should make it hard for the microorganism to develop resistance, their selective and pH-dependent activity, as well as pharmacological advantages due to the presence of d-amino acids, make them potential candidates for the treatment of mycoses in organs, under various pH environments, especially in cases where the bacterial flora should not be harmed.},

  Abstract                 = {Plant diseases constitute an emerging threat to global food security. Many of the currently available antimicrobial agents for agriculture are highly toxic and nonbiodegradable and cause extended environmental pollution. Moreover, an increasing number of phytopathogens develop resistance to them. Recently, we have reported on a new family of ultrashort antimicrobial lipopeptides which are composed of only four amino acids linked to fatty acids (A. Makovitzki, D. Avrahami, and Y. Shai, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 103:15997-16002, 2006). Here, we investigated the activities in vitro and in planta and the modes of action of these short lipopeptides against plant-pathogenic bacteria and fungi. They act rapidly, at low micromolar concentrations, on the membranes of the microorganisms via a lytic mechanism. In vitro microscopic analysis revealed wide-scale damage to the microorganism's membrane, in addition to inhibition of pathogen growth. In planta potent antifungal activity was demonstrated on cucumber fruits and leaves infected with the pathogen Botrytis cinerea as well as on corn leaves infected with Cochliobolus heterostrophus. Similarly, treatment with the lipopeptides of Arabidopsis leaves infected with the bacterial leaf pathogen Pseudomonas syringae efficiently and rapidly reduced the number of bacteria. Importantly, in contrast to what occurred with many native lipopeptides, no toxicity was observed on the plant tissues. These data suggest that the ultrashort lipopeptides could serve as native-like antimicrobial agents economically feasible for use in plant protection.},

  Abstract                 = {Many studies have shown that an amphipathic structure and a threshold of hydrophobicity of the peptidic chain are crucial for the biological function of AMPs (antimicrobial peptides). However, the factors that dictate their cell selectivity are not yet clear. In the present study, we show that the attachment of aliphatic acids with different lengths (10, 12, 14 or 16 carbon atoms) to the N-terminus of a biologically inactive cationic peptide is sufficient to endow the resulting lipopeptides with lytic activity against different cells. Mode-of-action studies were performed with model phospholipid membranes mimicking those of bacterial, mammalian and fungal cells. These include determination of the structure in solution and membranes by using CD and ATR-FTIR (attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared) spectroscopy, membrane leakage experiments and by visualizing bacterial and fungal damage via transmission electron microscopy. The results obtained reveal that: (i) the short lipopeptides (10 and 12 carbons atoms) are non-haemolytic, active towards both bacteria and fungi and monomeric in solution. (ii) The long lipopeptides (14 and 16 carbons atoms) are highly antifungal, haemolytic only at concentrations above their MIC (minimal inhibitory concentration) values and aggregate in solution. (iii) All the lipopeptides adopt a partial alpha-helical structure in 1\% lysophosphatidylcholine and bacterial and mammalian model membranes. However, the two short lipopeptides contain a significant fraction of random coil in fungal membranes, in agreement with their reduced antifungal activity. (iv) All the lipopeptides have a membranolytic effect on all types of cells assayed. Overall, the results reveal that the length of the aliphatic chain is sufficient to control the pathogen specificity of the lipopeptides, most probably by controlling both the overall hydrophobicity and the oligomeric state of the lipopeptides in solution. Besides providing us with basic important information, these new lipopeptides are potential candidates that can target bacteria and/or fungi, especially in cases where the bacterial flora should not be harmed.},

  abstract =    {Lipid bilayers represent a fascinating class of biomaterials whose properties are altered by changes in pressure or temperature. Functions of cellular membranes can be affected by nonspecific lipid-protein interactions that depend on bilayer material properties. Here we address the changes in lipid bilayer structure induced by external pressure. Solid-state Â²H NMR spectroscopy of phospholipid bilayers under osmotic stress allows structural fluctuations and deformation of membranes to be investigated. We highlight the results from NMR experiments utilizing pressure-based force techniques that control membrane structure and tension. Our Â²H NMR results using both dehydration pressure (low water activity) and osmotic pressure (poly(ethylene glycol) as osmolyte) show that the segmental order parameters (S(CD)) of DMPC approach very large values of â 0.35 in the liquid-crystalline state. The two stresses are thermodynamically equivalent, because the change in chemical potential when transferring water from the interlamellar space to the bulk water phase corresponds to the induced pressure. This theoretical equivalence is experimentally revealed by considering the solid-state Â²H NMR spectrometer as a virtual osmometer. Moreover, we extend this approach to include the correspondence between osmotic pressure and hydrostatic pressure. Our results establish the magnitude of the pressures that lead to significant bilayer deformation including changes in area per lipid and volumetric bilayer thickness. We find that appreciable bilayer structural changes occur with osmotic pressures in the range of 10-100 atm or lower. This research demonstrates the applicability of solid-state Â²H NMR spectroscopy together with bilayer stress techniques for investigating the mechanism of pressure sensitivity of membrane proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {We adapted existing polymer growth strategies for equilibrium sampling of peptides described by modern atomistic forcefields with a simple uniform dielectric solvent. The main novel feature of our approach is the use of precalculated statistical libraries of molecular fragments. A molecule is sampled by combining fragment configurations-of single residues in this study-which are stored in the libraries. Ensembles generated from the independent libraries are reweighted to conform with the Boltzmann-factor distribution of the forcefield describing the full molecule. In this way, high-quality equilibrium sampling of small peptides (4-8 residues) typically requires less than one hour of single-processor wallclock time and can be significantly faster than Langevin simulations. Furthermore, approximate, clash-free ensembles can be generated for larger peptides (up to 32 residues in this study) in less than a minute of single-processor computing. We discuss possible applications of our growth procedure to free energy calculation, fragment assembly protein-structure prediction protocols, and to "multi-resolution" sampling.

The data have been utilized to calculate the Gibbs energies of transfer of H+ ion from water to propan-1-ol + water mixtures. The limitations of the method have been discussed. The results have been explained in terms of ion-solvent interactions, structural variations and basicity of the solvent mixtures. The basicity of the aquo-organic mixtures increases, becomes maximum near about 43-53 wt% of organic cosolvent, then decreases and subsequently becomes less basic when the mole-fraction of organic cosolvent x(2), exceeds 0.5.

However, low cost development for therapeutic or industrial purposes requires, among other properties, that the peptides will be small and with simple structure. Therefore, considerable research has been devoted to optimizing peptide length combined with a simple design. This review focuses on the similarities and differences in the mode of action and target cell specificity of two families of small peptides: the naturally occurring temporins from the skin of amphibia and the engineered ultrashort lipopeptides. We will also discuss the finding that acylation of cationic peptides results in molecules with a more potent spectrum of activity and a higher resistance to proteolytic degradation. Conjugation of fatty acids to linear native peptide sequences is a powerful strategy to engineer novel successful anti-infective drugs.},

  Abstract                 = {We performed comparative DSC and FTIR spectroscopic measurements of the effects of cholesterol (Chol) and ergosterol (Erg) on the thermotropic phase behavior and organization of DPPC bilayers. Ergosterol is the major sterol in the biological membranes of yeasts, fungi and many protozoa. It differs from Chol in having two additional double bonds, one in the steroid nucleus at C7-8 and another in the alkyl chain at C22-23. Erg also has an additional methyl group in the alkyl chain at C24. Our DSC studies indicate that the incorporation of Erg is more effective than Chol is in reducing the enthalpy of the pretransition. At lower concentrations Erg is also more effective than Chol in reducing the enthalpies of both the sharp and broad components of main phase transition. However, at sterol concentrations from 30 to 50 mol\%, Erg is generally less effective at reducing the enthalpy of the broad components and does not completely abolish the cooperative hydrocarbon chain-melting phase transition at 50 mol\%, as does Chol. Nevertheless, in this higher ergosterol concentration range, there is no evidence of the formation of ergosterol crystallites. Our FTIR spectroscopic studies demonstrate that Erg incorporation produces a similar ordering of liquid-crystalline DPPC bilayers as does Chol, but an increased degree of hydrogen bonding of the fatty acyl carbonyl groups in the glycerol backbone region of the DPPC bilayer. These and other results indicate that Erg is less miscible in DPPC bilayers at higher concentrations than is Chol. Finally, we provide a tentative molecular explanation for the comparative experimental and computation results obtained for Erg and Chol in phospholipid bilayers, emphasizing the dynamic conformational differences between these two sterols.},

The fluorescently labeled Rh molecules were fully functional, as measured by their ability to activate the G protein transducin. The luminescence resonance energy transfer measurements revealed a distance of 47-50 Angstroms between Rh molecules. The measured efficiency of FRET between receptors was close to the theoretical maximum possible, indicating nearly quantitative Rh-Rh association.

  Abstract                 = {Resistance to nucleoside analogue inhibitors of the reverse transcriptase of the HIV-1 often involves phosphorolytic excision of the incorporated chain terminator. Previous crystallographic and modeling studies suggested that this reaction could only occur when the enzyme resides in a pre-translocational stage. Here we studied mechanisms of polymerase translocation using novel site-specific footprinting techniques. Classical footprinting approaches, based on the detection of protected nucleic acid residues, are not sensitive enough to visualize subtle structural differences at single nucleotide resolution. Thus, we developed chemical footprinting techniques that give rise to hyperreactive cleavage on the template strand mediated through specific contacts with the enzyme. Two specific cuts served as markers that defined the position of the polymerase and RNase H domain, respectively. We show that the presence of the next correct dNTP, following the incorporated chain terminator, caused a shift in the position of the two cuts a single nucleotide further downstream. The footprints point to monotonic sliding motions and provide compelling evidence for the existence of an equilibrium between pre- and post-translocational stages. Our data show that enzyme translocation is reversible and uncoupled from nucleotide incorporation and the release of pyrophosphate. This translocational equilibrium ensures access to the pre-translocational stage after incorporation of the chain terminator. The efficiency of excision correlates with an increase in the population of complexes that exist in the pre-translocational stage, and we show that the latter configuration is preferred with an enzyme that contains mutations associated with resistance to nucleoside analogue inhibitors.},

  Abstract                 = {Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) is a chemokine that is expressed by a variety of tissue cells in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as IL-1beta, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. A major function of MCP-1 is the recruitment and activation of monocytes and T lymphocytes. Overexpression of MCP-1 has been implicated in a number of diseases, including glomerulonephritis and rheumatoid arthritis, indicating that the modulation of MCP-1 activity and/or expression is a desired therapeutic strategy. In the present study, our aim was to test whether the MCP-1 expression could be inhibited at the transcriptional level using triple helix-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs). We designed a TFO targeted to the SP-1 binding site in the human MCP-1 gene promoter. Gel mobility shift assays demonstrated that the phosphodiester TFO formed a sequence-specific triplex with its dsDNA target with an EC50 of approximately 1.9 x 10(-7) M. The corresponding phosphorothioated oligonucleotide was also effective in this assay with an 8-fold higher EC50 value. Binding of the TFO to the target DNA prevented the binding of rSP-1 and of nuclear proteins in vitro. The TFO could also partially inhibit endogenous MCP-1 gene expression in cultured human embryonic kidney cells. Treatment of TNF-alpha-stimulated human embryonic kidney 293 cells with the TFO inhibited the secretion of MCP-1 in a dose-dependent manner (up to 45\% at 5 microM oligonucleotide). The inhibition of MCP secretion was caused at the level of gene transcription, because MCP-1 mRNA levels in oligonucleotide-treated cells were also decreased by approximately 40\%.},

Initial barriers to their success are being increasingly overcome with the development of stable, more cost-effective and potent broad-spectrum synthetic peptides. Thus, there is hope that they will spawn a new generation of antimicrobials with a broad range of topical and systemic applications against infections.},

  Abstract                 = {Here, we use coarse grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the spontaneous aggregation of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) lipids into small unilamellar vesicles. We show that the aggregation process occurs on a nanosecond time scale, with bicelles and cuplike vesicles formed at intermediate stages. Formation of hemifused vesicles is also observed at higher lipid concentration. With either 25\% dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE) or lysoPC mixed into the system, the final stages of the aggregation process occur significantly faster. The structure of the spontaneously formed vesicles is analyzed in detail. Microsecond simulations of isolated vesicles reveal significant differences in the packing of the lipids between the inner and outer monolayers, and between PC, PE, and lysoPC. Due to the small size of the vesicles they remain almost perfectly spherical, undergoing very limited shape fluctuations or bilayer undulations. The lipid lateral diffusion rate is found to be faster in the outer than in the inner monolayer. The water permeability coefficient of the pure DPPC vesicles is of the order of 10(-)(3) cm s(-)(1), in agreement with experimental measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {We describe molecular dynamics simulations elucidating the molecular details of the process of fusion for small lipid vesicles. The simulations are based on a coarse grained (CG) lipid model that accurately represents the lamellar state of a variety of phospholipids and enables us to observe intermediate stages during fusion at near atomic detail. Simulations were conducted on a variety of systems containing common phospholipids such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), lysoPC, and mixtures of the above. The fusion intermediates found are in general agreement with the stalk-pore mechanism. Transient pores sometimes form adjacent to the stalk, however, resulting in the mixing of lipids from the outer and inner monolayers. The speed of stalk formation and the opening of the fusion pore can be modulated by altering the lipid composition in qualitative agreement with experimental observations.},

  abstract    = {We present an improved and extended version of our coarse grained lipid model. The new version, coined the MARTINI force field, is parametrized in a systematic way, based on the reproduction of partitioning free energies between polar and apolar phases of a large number of chemical compounds. To reproduce the free energies of these chemical building blocks, the number of possible interaction levels of the coarse-grained sites has increased compared to those of the previous model. Application of the new model to lipid bilayers shows an improved behavior in terms of the stress profile across the bilayer and the tendency to form pores. An extension of the force field now also allows the simulation of planar (ring) compounds, including sterols. Application to a bilayer/cholesterol system at various concentrations shows the typical cholesterol condensation effect similar to that observed in all atom representations.},

  Abstract                 = {The transformation between a gel and a fluid phase in dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers has been simulated using a coarse grained (CG) model by cooling bilayer patches composed of up to 8000 lipids. The critical step in the transformation process is the nucleation of a gel cluster consisting of 20-80 lipids, spanning both monolayers. After the formation of the critical cluster, a fast growth regime is entered. Growth slows when multiple gel domains start interacting, forming a percolating network. Long-lived fluid domains remain trapped and can be metastable on a microsecond time scale. From the temperature dependence of the rate of cluster growth, the line tension of the fluid-gel interface was estimated to be 3+/-2 pN. The reverse process is observed when heating the gel phase. No evidence is found for a hexatic phase as an intermediate stage of melting. The hysteresis observed in the freezing and melting transformation is found to depend both on the system size and on the time scale of the simulation. Extrapolating to macroscopic length and time scales, the transition temperature for heating and cooling converges to 295+/-5 K, in semi-quantitative agreement with the experimental value for DPPC (315 K). The phase transformation is associated with a drop in lateral mobility of the lipids by two orders of magnitude, and an increase in the rotational correlation time of the same order of magnitude. The lipid headgroups, however, remain fluid. These observations are in agreement with experimental findings, and show that the nature of the ordered phase obtained with the CG model is indeed a gel rather than a crystalline phase. Simulations performed at different levels of hydration furthermore show that the gel phase is stabilized at low hydration. A simulation of a small DPPC vesicle reveals that curvature has the opposite effect.},

  Abstract                 = {Photoisomerization of the retinylidene chromophore of rhodopsin is the starting point in the vision cascade. A counterion switch mechanism that stabilizes the retinal protonated Schiff base (PSB) has been proposed to be an essential step in rhodopsin activation. On the basis of vibrational and UV-visible spectroscopy, two counterion switch models have emerged. In the first model, the PSB is stabilized by Glu181 in the meta I state, while in the most recent proposal, it is stabilized by Glu113 as well as Glu181. We assess these models by conducting a pair of microsecond scale, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of rhodopsin embedded in a 99-lipid bilayer of SDPC, SDPE, and cholesterol (2:2:1 ratio) varying the starting protonation state of Glu181. Theoretical simulations gave different orientations of retinal for the two counterion switch mechanisms, which were used to simulate experimental 2H NMR spectra for the C5, C9, and C13 methyl groups. Comparison of the simulated 2H NMR spectra with experimental data supports the complex-counterion mechanism. Hence, our results indicate that Glu113 and Glu181 stabilize the retinal PSB in the meta I state prior to activation of rhodopsin.},

As models, we use one-component membranes composed of glycerol-based phosphatidylcholines (PCs) with monounsaturated acyl chains, and we complement these studies by additional PC/cholesterol simulations. We compare differences between double-bond parametrizations by varying the position of the double bond systematically along the lipid hydrocarbon chains. The results give rise for concern: They indicate that the double-bond description may change not only the quantitative but also the qualitative nature of membrane behavior. In particular, we find that the double-bond description which accounts for skew states in the vicinity of a double bond predicts a maximum in membrane disorder, when the double bond resides at the middle of an acyl chain, in agreement with experiments. The more commonly used description which does not accommodate skew states, however, predicts membrane disorder to decrease monotonically as the double bond is shifted from the glycerol backbone to the end of an acyl chain. The results highlight the importance of properly describing double bonds especially in many-component membranes, where the interplay of different molecule types is difficult to predict on intuitive grounds. {\copyright}2008 American Institute of Physics},

  Abstract                 = {Cationic amphipathic alpha-helical peptides preferentially disrupt anionic lipids in mixed model membranes, potentially causing a catastrophic release of the cell contents or attenuation of the membrane potential. The effective role of such peptides requires considerable discrimination between target and host cells, which is likely to occur at the level of the cell membrane. Here, we explore the roles of a variety of common membrane constituents in mediating the interaction between the antimicrobial peptide pleurocidin and model membranes. We employ intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and circular dichroism to observe the effect of increasing concentrations of sterol in the membrane on peptide binding, using (2)H solid-state NMR of chain deuterated lipids simultaneously to probe the effective chain disruption of the anionic phospholipid component of the membrane. We show that the degree of ordering of the lipid acyl chains in the membrane is dependent on the nature of the zwitterionic phospholipid headgroup in mixed anionic membranes. Furthermore, the presence of cholesterol and ergosterol increases acyl chain order in the liquid crystalline model membranes, but to differing degrees. Our results show how sterols can protect even negatively charged membranes from the disruptive effects of antimicrobial peptides, thereby providing a molecular view of the differences in sensitivity of various target membranes to linear cationic antibiotic peptides where bacteria (no sterols) are most susceptible, lower eukaryotes including fungi (containing ergosterol) exhibit an intermediate degree of sensitivity, and higher organisms (containing cholesterol) are largely resistant to antimicrobial peptides.},

To establish the interaction, we measured (2)H NMR using deuterium-labeled sterols and AmB. The (2)H NMR spectra of deuterated ergosterol in palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) bilayers showed that fast axial diffusion of erogosterol was almost completely inhibited by the coexistence of AmB. Conversely, cholesterol mobility in POPC membrane was essentially unchanged with or without AmB. These results unequivocally demonstrate that ergosterol has significant interaction with AmB in POPC bilayers. In addition, we examined the mobility of AmB using deuterium-labeled AmB, and found that, although AmB is almost immobilized in sterol-free and cholesterol-containing POPC membranes, a certain ratio of AmB molecules acquires mobility in the presence of ergosterol. The similar mobility of AmB and ergosterol in POPC bilayers confirmed the idea of the direct intermolecular interaction between ergosterol and AmB.},

Here, we applied cryo electron tomography to capture 3D intermediates from Herpes simplex virus 1 fusion at the plasma membrane in their native environment by using two model systems: adherent cells and synaptosomes. The fusion process was delineated as a series of structurally different steps. The incoming capsid separated from the tegument and was closely surrounded by the cortical cytoskeleton. After entry, the viral membrane curvature changed concomitantly with a reorganization of the envelope glycoprotein spikes. Individual glycoprotein complexes in transitional conformations during pore formation and dilation revealed the complex viral fusion mechanism in action. Snapshots of the fusion intermediates provide unprecedented details concerning the overall structural changes occurring during herpesvirus entry. Moreover, our data suggest that there are two functional Ã¢ÂÂpolesÃ¢ÂÂ of the asymmetric herpesvirion: one related to cell entry, and the other formed during virus assembly.},

  abstract             = {The field of protein structure prediction has seen significant advances in recent years. Researchers have followed a multitude of approaches, including methods based on comparative modeling, fold recognition and threading, and first-principles techniques. It is noteworthy that the structure prediction of membrane proteins is comparatively less studied by researchers in the field. A membrane protein is characterized by a protein structure that extends into or through the lipid-lipid bilayer of a cell. The structure is influenced by the combination of the hydrophobic bilayer region, the direct interaction with the bilayer, and the aqueous external environment. Due to the difficulty in obtaining reliable experimental structures, accurate computational prediction of membrane proteins is of paramount importance. An optimization model has been developed to predict the interhelical interactions in{alpha} -helical membrane proteins. A database of{alpha} -helical membrane proteins of known structure and limited sequence identity can be constructed to develop interaction probabilities. By then maximizing the occurrence of highly probable pairwise or three-residue interactions, realistic contacts can be predicted by imposing a number of geometrical constraints. The development of these low distance contacts can provide additional distance restraints for first principles-based approaches to the tertiary structure prediction problem. The proposed approach is shown to successfully predict interhelical contacts in several membrane protein systems, including bovine rhodopsin and the recently released human {beta}2 adrenergic receptor protein structure. 10.1529/biophysj.108.132241},

  annotation = {DNA structure is well known to be sensitive to hydration and ionic strength. Recent theoretical predictions and experimental observations have raised the idea of the intrusion of monovalent cations into the minor groove spine of hydration in B-form DNA. To investigate this further, extensions and further analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on d(CGCCGAATTCGCG), d(ATAGGCAAAAAATAGG-CAAAAATGG) and d(G(5)- (GA(4)T(4)C)(2)-C-5), including counterions and water, have been performed. To examine the effective of minor groove ions on structure, we analyzed the MD snapshots from a 15 ns trajectory on d(CGCGAATTCGCC) as two subsets: those exhibiting a minor groove water spine and those with groove-bound ions. The results indicate that Na+ at the ApT step of the minor groove of d(CGCCGAATTCGCG) makes only small local changes in the DNA structure, and these changes are well within the thermal fluctuations calculated from the MD. To examine the effect of ions on the differential stability of a B-form helix, further analysis was performed on two Longer oligonucleotides, which exhibit A-tract-induced axis bending localized around the CpG step in the major groove. Plots of axis bending and proximity of ions to the bending locus were generated as a function of time and revealed a strong linear correlation, supporting the idea that mobile cations play a key role in local helix deformations of DNA and indicating ion proximity just precedes the bending event. To address the issue of 'what's in charge?' of DNA structure more generally, the relative free energy of A and B-form d(CGCCAATTCGCC) structures from MD simulations under various environmental circumstances were estimated using the free energy component method. The results indicate that the dominant effects on conformational stability come from the electrostatic free energy, but not exclusively from groove bound ions per sc, but from a balance of competing factors in the electrostatic free energy, including phosphate repulsions internal to the DNA, the electrostatic component of hydration (i.e. solvent polarization), and electrostatic effects of the counterion atmosphere. In summary, free energy calculations indicate that the electrostatic component is dominant, MD shows temporal proximity of mobile counterions to be correlated with A-track- induced bending, and thus the mobile ion component of electrostatics is a significant contributor. However, the MD structure of the dodecamer d(CGCGAATTCGCG) is not highly sensitive to whether there is a sodium ion in the minor groove. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

The models have been developed at many different levels of theory, going all the way from simple analytical models of packing effects to atomistic descriptions using molecular dynamics methods. In between these limits are mean-field and coarse-grained models, including models for DNA, peptides, and lipids that can be used to describe the assembly of hybrid (amphiphilic) materials. Several recent applications to specific systems are discussed, including the description of peptide amphiphile assembly to make cylindrical micelles, the assembly and melting of DNA hairpins, the use of DNA tethers to assemble nanoparticles into aggregates and crystalline structures, and the use of coarse-grained lipid models to make lamellar and high-curvature phases. These examples demonstrate the difficulties associated with brute force atomistic methods, and they also show the opportunities (but uncertainties and ambiguities) associated with simpler models such as coarse-grained models. The examples also demonstrate the usefulness of successful modeling methods in the design of new materials, including an understanding of the relationship between structure and function.},

Standard OPLS Lennard-Jones parameters are used for the nonbonded interactions in conjunction with partial charges obtained from fitting to RHF/6-31G* electrostatic potential surfaces. The harmonic bond stretching and angle bending terms are adopted mostly from the AMBER force field, although the addition of two new atom types was required.

  Abstract                 = {The stability of the complex between IgE and its high-affinity receptor, FcepsilonRI, on mast cells is a critical factor in the allergic response. The long half-life of the complex of IgE bound to this receptor in situ ( approximately 2 weeks, compared with only hours for the comparable IgG complex) contributes to the permanent sensitization of these cells and, hence, to the immediate response to allergens. Here we show that the second constant domain of IgE, Cepsilon2, which takes the place of the flexible hinge in IgG, contributes to this long half-life. When the Cepsilon2 domain is deleted from the IgE Fc fragment, leaving only the Cepsilon3 and Cepsilon4 domains (Cepsilon3-4 fragment), the rate of dissociation from the receptor is increased by greater than 1 order of magnitude. We report the structure of the Cepsilon2 domain by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy and show by chemical shift perturbation that it interacts with FcepsilonRIalpha. By sedimentation equilibrium we show that the Cepsilon2 domain binds to the Cepsilon3-4 fragment of IgE. These interactions of Cepsilon2 with both FcepsilonRIalpha and Cepsilon3-4 provide a structural explanation for the exceptionally slow dissociation of the IgE-FcepsilonRIalpha complex.},

These models provide both a quantitative and comprehensible description of the long-time scale dynamics of large molecular dynamics with a Master equation and have been successfully used to study protein folding, protein conformational change, and protein-ligand binding. However, to achieve satisfactory performance, existing methodologies often require expert intervention when defining the model's discrete state space. While standard model selection methodologies focus on the minimization of systematic bias and disregard statistical error, we show that by consideration of the states' conditional distribution over conformations, both sources of error can be balanced evenhandedly. Application of techniques that consider both systematic bias and statistical error on two 100 Î¼s molecular dynamics trajectories of the Fip35 WW domain shows agreement with existing techniques based on self-consistency of the model's relaxation time scales with more suitable results in regimes in which those time scale-based techniques encourage overfitting. By removing the need for expert tuning, these methods should reduce modeling bias and lower the barriers to entry in Markov state model construction.},

  abstract        = {Following a previous study that demonstrated a correlation between rhodopsin stability and the severity of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), we investigated whether predictions of severity can be improved with a regional analysis of this correlation. The association between changes to the stability of the protein and the relative amount of rhodopsin reaching the plasma membrane was assessed. Crystallography-based estimations of mutant rhodopsin stability were compared with descriptions in the scientific literature of the visual function of mutation carriers to determine the extent of associations between rhodopsin stability and clinical phenotype. To test the findings of this analysis, three residues of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged rhodopsin plasmid were targeted with site-directed random mutagenesis to generate mutant variants with a range of stability changes. These plasmids were transfected into HEK-293 cells, and then flow cytometry was used to measure rhodopsin on the cells' plasma membrane. The GFP signal was used to measure the ratio between this membrane-bound rhodopsin and total cellular rhodopsin. FoldX stability predictions were then compared with the surface staining data and clinical data from the database to characterize the relationship between rhodopsin stability, the severity of RP, and the expression of rhodopsin at the cell surface. There was a strong linear correlation between the scale of the destabilization of mutant variants and the severity of retinal disease. A correlation was also seen in vitro between stability and the amount of rhodopsin at the plasma membrane. Rhodopsin is drastically reduced on the surface of cells transfected with variants that differ in their inherent stability from the wild-type by more than 2 kcal/mol. Below this threshold, surface levels are closer to those of the wild-type. There is a correlation between the stability of rhodopsin mutations and disease severity and levels of membrane-bound rhodopsin. Measuring membrane-bound rhodopsin with flow cytometry could improve prognoses for poorly characterized mutations and could provide a platform for measuring the effectiveness of treatments.},

  Abstract                 = {We report a first test of the hypothesis that the mechanism of antimicrobial, cytolytic, and amphipathic cell-penetrating peptides in model membranes is determined by the thermodynamics of insertion of the peptide into the lipid bilayer from the surface-associated state. Three peptides were designed with minimal mutations relative to the sequence of TP10W, the Y3W variant of transportan 10, which is a helical, amphipathic cell-penetrating peptide previously studied. Binding to 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) membranes and release of dye from those vesicles were assessed by stopped-flow fluorescence, and the secondary structure of the peptides on the membrane was determined by circular dichroism. The Gibbs energy of binding determined experimentally was in excellent agreement with that calculated using the Wimley-White interfacial hydrophobicity scale, taking into account the helical content of the membrane-associated peptide. Release of dye from POPC vesicles remained graded, as predicted by the hypothesis. More significantly, as the Gibbs energy of insertion into the bilayer became more unfavorable, which was estimated using the Wimley-White octanol hydrophobicity scale, dye release became slower, in quantitative agreement with the prediction.},

  Abstract                 = {Mammalian Toll-like receptor (TLR) proteins are new members of the IL-1 receptor family that participate in activation of cells by bacteria and bacterial products. Several recent reports indicate that TLR proteins mediate cellular activation by bacterial LPS via a signaling pathway that is largely shared by the type I IL-1 receptor. We previously showed that Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblasts engineered to express CD14 (CHO/CD14) were responsive to LPS, but not to a distinct CD14 ligand, mycobacterial lipoarabinomannan (LAM). These CHO/CD14 cells were subsequently found to possess a frame-shift mutation within the TLR2 gene which resulted in their inability to express functional TLR2 protein. Thus, we hypothesized that TLR2, but not TLR4, was necessary for LAM signaling. In this paper we show that CHO/CD14 cells engineered to express functional TLR2 protein acquired the ability to be activated by LAM. Similarly, overexpression of TLR2 in murine macrophages conferred enhanced LAM responsiveness. Together, our data demonstrate that the distinct CD14 ligands LAM and LPS utilize different TLR proteins to initiate intracellular signals. These findings suggest a novel receptor signaling paradigm in which the binding of distinct ligands is mediated by a common receptor chain, but cellular activation is initiated via distinct signal-transducing chains that confer ligand specificity. This paradigm contrasts with many cytokine receptor complexes in which receptor specificity is conferred by a unique ligand-binding chain but cellular activation is initiated via shared signal-transducing chains.},

  Abstract                 = {With the help of the crystal structure of rhodopsin an ab initio method has been developed to calculate the three-dimensional structure of the loops that connect the transmembrane helices (TMHs). The goal of this procedure is to calculate the loop structures in other G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) for which only model coordinates of the TMHs are available. To mimic this situation a construct of rhodopsin was used that only includes the experimental coordinates of the TMHs while the rest of the structure, including the terminal domains, has been removed. To calculate the structure of the loops a method was designed based on Monte Carlo (MC) simulations which use a temperature annealing protocol, and a scaled collective variables (SCV) technique with proper structural constraints. Because only part of the protein is used in the calculations the usual approach of modeling loops, which consists of finding a single, lowest energy conformation of the system, is abandoned because such a single structure may not be a representative member of the native ensemble. Instead, the method was designed to generate structural ensembles from which the single lowest free energy ensemble is identified as representative of the native folding of the loop. To find the native ensemble a successive series of SCV-MC simulations are carried out to allow the loops to undergo structural changes in a controlled manner. To increase the chances of finding the native funnel for the loop, some of the SCV-MC simulations are carried out at elevated temperatures. The native ensemble can be identified by an MC search starting from any conformation already in the native funnel. The hypothesis is that native structures are trapped in the conformational space because of the high-energy barriers that surround the native funnel. The existence of such ensembles is demonstrated by generating multiple copies of the loops from their crystal structures in rhodopsin and carrying out an extended SCV-MC search. For the extracellular loops e1 and e3, and the intracellular loop i1 that were used in this work, the procedure resulted in dense clusters of structures with C alpha-RMSD similar to 0.5 angstrom. To test the predictive power of the method the crystal structure of each loop was replaced by its extended conformations. For e1 and i1 the procedure identifies native clusters with C alpha-RMSD similar to 0.5 angstrom and good structural overlap of the side chains; for e3, two clusters were found with C alpha-RMSD similar to 1.1 angstrom each, but with poor overlap of the side chains. Further searching led to a single cluster with lower C alpha-RMSD but higher energy than the two previous clusters. This discrepancy was found to be due to the missing elements in the constructs available from experiment for use in the calculations. Because this problem will likely appear whenever parts of the structural information are missing, possible solutions are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Staphylococcal protein A (SpA) is a cell-surface component of Staphylococcus aureus. In addition to the well-characterized interaction between SpA and the Fc-region of human IgG, an alternative binding interaction between SpA and the Fab-region of immunoglobulin domains encoded by the V(H)3 gene family has been described. To characterize structurally the interface formed by SpA repeats and type-3 V(H)-domains, we have studied the 32-kDa complex formed between an E-domain mutant (EZ4) and the Fv-fragment of the humanized anti-HER2 antibody (Hu4D5-8) using heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy. Protocols were established for efficient incorporation of (15)N, (13)C, and (2)H into EZ4 and the V(H)- and V(L)-domains of the Fv, allowing backbone resonances to be assigned sequentially for EZ4 and the V(H)-domain in both free and complexed states. Broadening of certain V(H)-resonances in the free and bound Fv-fragment suggests microsecond to millisecond time-scale motion in CDR3. Residues experiencing significant chemical shift changes of backbone (1)H(N), (15)N, and (13)CO resonances upon complex formation delineate contiguous surfaces on EZ4 and the V(H)-domain that define the binding interfaces of the two proteins. The interaction surfaces identified by chemical shift mapping are comprised of predominantly hydrophilic residues. This is in contrast to the SpA-Fc interface which is predominantly hydrophobic in nature. Further analysis of the surface properties suggests a probable binding orientation for SpA- and V(H)3-domains.},

Aqueous trifluoroethanol (TFE) was chosen as the solvent since the overall structure of PxB in TFE is similar to the structure when bound to vesicles. No differences were observed between the two peptides for 1H HÃÂ± chemical shifts or patterns of cross peaks in NOESY spectra, indicating that the overall structures are quite similar. The sign and intensity of NOESY spectra obtained at different temperatures were used to assess the relative mobility of the peptides. For both peptides, differential mobility is observed in different parts of the molecule, with greater mobility observed for the linear portion than the ring and faster motion seen for the side chains than the peptide backbone. However, all motion is faster in the nonapeptide, indicating that the presence of the N-terminal acyl chain restricts the mobility of PxB compared to the nonapeptide, which lacks this structural feature. For both peptides, differential mobility is also observed within the cyclic portion of the peptide. This supports a proposed model whereby the more rigid residues serve as pivot points, allowing the ring conformation to change in response to different binding partners. However, conformational flexibility within the cyclic ring is not sufficient for antimicrobial activity since both the active and inactive peptides exhibit the same flexibility. The N-terminal acyl chain on PxB, which is essential for activity, exhibits rapid, independent motion, and this flexibility may facilitate penetration of the outer membrane.},

Electrophysiology experiments carried out in reconstituted lipid membranes formed from phosphatidylcholines with one (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine - POPC) and two monounsaturated acyl chains (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine - DOPC) demonstrate that the lesser degree of the packing density of membrane lipids encountered in DOPC-based planar membranes greatly enhances the electric activity of pores created by the HPA3 peptide. Data derived from fluorescence spectroscopy experiments demonstrate that upon interaction with the bilayer, the HPA3 peptide translocates to the trans-side of the membrane. From the same experiments, we demonstrate that in the case of DOPC-based planar membranes, the net amount of HPA3 peptide which passes across the membrane and re-dissolves in the trans solution is almost 22\% greater than POPC-based membranes. Such data further emphasize the modulatory role played by lipid acyl chain in determining antimicrobial peptides-lipids interactions, and demonstrate that small differences in unsaturation degree can impose a sizeable influence on HPA3 peptide activity.},

  Abstract                 = {Rhodopsin has served as the primary model for studying G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)-the largest group in the human genome, and consequently a primary target for pharmaceutical development. Understanding the functions and activation mechanisms of GPCRs has proven to be extraordinarily difficult, as they are part of a complex signaling cascade and reside within the cell membrane. Although X-ray crystallography has recently solved several GPCR structures that may resemble the activated conformation, the dynamics and mechanism of rhodopsin activation continue to remain elusive. Notably solid-state ((2))H NMR spectroscopy provides key information pertinent to how local dynamics of the retinal ligand change during rhodopsin activation. When combined with molecular mechanics simulations of proteolipid membranes, a new paradigm for the rhodopsin activation process emerges. Experiment and simulation both suggest that retinal isomerization initiates the rhodopsin photocascade to yield not a single activated structure, but rather an ensemble of activated conformational states.

  Abstract                 = {Evaluating the free-energy landscape of proteins and the corresponding functional aspects presents a major challenge for computer simulation approaches. This challenge is due to the complexity of the landscape and the enormous computer time needed for converging simulations. The use of simplified coarse-grained (CG) folding models offers an effective way of sampling the landscape but such a treatment, however, may not give the correct description of the effect of the actual protein residues. A general way around this problem that has been put forward in our early work (Fan et al., Theor Chem Acc 1999;103:77-80) uses the CG model as a reference potential for free-energy calculations of different properties of the explicit model. This method is refined and extended here, focusing on improving the electrostatic treatment and on demonstrating key applications. These applications include: evaluation of changes of folding energy upon mutations, calculations of transition-states binding free energies (which are crucial for rational enzyme design), evaluations of catalytic landscape, and evaluations of the time-dependent responses to pH changes. Furthermore, the general potential of our approach in overcoming major challenges in studies of structure function correlation in proteins is discussed. Proteins 2010. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {The most critical step in the production of diphtheria vaccines is the inactivation of the toxin by formaldehyde. Diphtheria toxoid (DTx) is produced during this inactivation process through partly unknown, chemical modifications of the toxin. Consequently, diphtheria vaccines are difficult to characterise completely and the quality of the toxoids is routinely determined with potency and safety tests. This article describes the possibility of monitoring the quality in diphtheria vaccine production with a selection of physicochemical and immunochemical tests as an alternative to established in vivo tests. To this end, diphtheria toxin was treated with increasing formaldehyde concentrations resulting in toxoid products varying in potency and residual toxicity. Differences in the quality of the experimental toxoids were also assessed with physicochemical and immunochemical techniques. The results obtained with several of these analyses, including SDS-PAGE, primary amino group determination, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) and biosensor analysis, showed a clear correlation with the potency and safety tests. A set of criteria is proposed that a diphtheria toxoid must comply with, i.e. an apparent shift of the B-fragment on SDS-PAGE, a reduction of primary amino groups in a diphtheria molecule, an increased resistance to denaturation, an increased circular dichroism signal in the near-UV region and a reduced binding to selected monoclonal antibodies. In principle, a selected set of in vitro analyses can replace the classical in vivo tests to evaluate the quality of diphtheria toxoid vaccines, provided that the validity of these tests is demonstrated in extensive validation studies and regulatory acceptance is obtained.},

To gain insight into the lipid-mediated interactions between two intrinsic membrane proteins, we developed a mesoscopic model of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins, which we studied with dissipative particle dynamics. Our calculations of the potential of mean force (PMF) between transmembrane proteins show that hydrophobic forces drive long range protein-protein interactions whose nature depends on the length of the protein hydrophobic segment, on the three dimensional structure of the protein and on the properties of the lipid bilayer. To understand the nature of the computed PMFs, the concept of hydrophilic shielding is introduced. The observed protein interactions are interpreted as resulting from the dynamic reorganization of the system to maintain an optimal hydrophilic shielding of the protein and lipid hydrophobic parts, within the constraint of the flexibility of the components. Our results could lead to a better understanding of several membrane processes in which protein interactions are involved. 10.1529/biophysj.107.124164},

  abstract        = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important membrane proteins that mediate cellular signaling and represent primary targets for about one-third of currently marketed drugs. Recent x-ray crystallographic studies identified distinct conformations of GPCRs in the active and inactive states. An allosteric sodium ion was found bound to a highly conserved D2.50 residue in inactive GPCRs, whereas the D2.50 allosteric pocket became collapsed in active GPCR structures. However, the dynamic mechanisms underlying these observations remain elusive. In this study, we aimed to understand the mechanistic effects of sodium ion binding on dynamic activation of the M3 muscarinic GPCR through long-timescale accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations. Results showed that with the D2.50 residue deprotonated, the M3 receptor is bound by an allosteric sodium ion and confined mostly in the inactive state with remarkably reduced flexibility. In contrast, the D2.50-protonated receptor does not exhibit sodium ion binding to the D2.50 allosteric site and samples a significantly larger conformational space. The receptor activation is captured and characterized by large-scale structural rearrangements of the transmembrane helices via dynamic hydrogen bond and salt bridge interactions. The residue motions are highly correlated during receptor activation. Further network analysis revealed that the allosteric signaling between residue D2.50 and key residues in the intracellular, extracellular, and orthosteric pockets is significantly weakened upon sodium ion binding.},

The use of the program is described with three proteins: 1YJP , 1O1O , and 1UFY . Source code is provided allowing CHARMMing to be downloaded, installed, and used by supercomputing centers and research groups that have a CHARMM license. Although no software can replace a scientist's own judgment and experience, CHARMMing eases the introduction of newcomers to the molecular modeling discipline by providing a graphical method for running simulations.},

Several lessons have already been developed with new ones easily added via a provided Python script. In addition to CHARMMing's new lessons functionality, web-based graphical capabilities have been overhauled and are fully compatible with modern mobile web browsers (e.g., phones and tablets), allowing easy integration of these advanced simulation techniques into coursework. Finally, one of the primary objections to web-based systems like CHARMMing has been that "point and click" simulation set-up does little to teach the user about the underlying physics, biology, and computational methods being applied. In response to this criticism, we have developed a freely available tutorial to bridge the gap between graphical simulation setup and the technical knowledge necessary to perform simulations without user interface assistance.},

Hydrodynamic radii of 6 A were assigned to each alpha-carbon on the basis of matching experimental translational and rotational diffusion constants of lysozyme, myoglobin, and hemoglobin with those calculated using a rigid body bead model with hydrodynamic interactions described by the Rotne-Prager tensor. LNM analysis of myosin II indicates that all ENM-like modes are overdamped at water viscosities. The low-frequency LNM modes in the pre-power stroke structure (PDB code: 1VOM) are substantially less mixed than the corresponding modes of the post-power stroke structure (1Q5G). Results from a four-bead model of the myosin "lever arm" indicate that coupling between modes increases as the array departs from linearity and are consistent with the results for 1VOM and 1Q5G. The decay times for all overdamped Langevin modes are shorter than the calculated rotational tumbling times found for lysozyme and myosin.},

  Abstract                 = {The surface activity of beta-peptides is investigated using molecular simulations. The type and display of hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups on helical beta-peptides is varied systematically. Peptides with 2/3 hydrophobic groups are found to be surface active, and to adopt an orientation parallel to the air-water interface. For select beta-peptides, we also determine the potential of mean force required to bring a peptide to the air-water interface. Facially amphiphilic helices with 2/3 hydrophobic groups are found to exhibit the lowest free energy of adsorption. The adsorption process is driven by a favorable energetic term and opposed by negative entropic changes. The temperature dependence of adsorption is also investigated; facially amphiphilic helices are found to adopt orientations that are largely independent of temperature, while nonfacially amphiphilic helices sample a broader range of interfacial orientations at elevated temperatures. The thermodynamics of adsorption of beta-peptides is compared to that of 1-octanol, a well-known surfactant, and ovispirin, a naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide. It is found that the essential difference lies in the sign of the entropy of adsorption, which is negative for beta- and alpha-peptides and positive for traditional surfactants such as octanol.},

The addition of 40\% cholesterol to either DOPC or DPPC changes the WAXS pattern due to an increase in acyl chain orientational order, which is one of the main properties distinguishing the cholesterol-rich liquid-ordered (Lo) phase from the liquid-disordered (Ld) phase. In contrast, powder x-ray data from multilamellar vesicles does not yield information about orientational order, and the scattering from the Lo and Ld phases looks similar. An analytical model to describe the relationship between the chain orientational distribution and WAXS data was used to obtain an average orientational order parameter, Sx-ray. When 40\% cholesterol is added to either DOPC or DPPC, Sx-ray more than doubles, consistent with previous NMR order parameter measurements. By combining information about the average chain orientation with the chain-chain correlation spacing, we extended a commonly used method for calculating areas for gel-phase lipids to fluid-phase lipids and obtained agreement to within 5\% of literature values. 10.1529/biophysj.107.127845},

  Abstract                 = {Wide angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) from oriented lipid multilayers is used to examine liquid-ordered (Lo)/liquid-disordered (Ld) phase coexistence in the system 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/cholesterol (DOPC/DPPC/Chol), which is a model for the outer leaflet of the animal cell plasma membrane. Using the method of analysis developed in the accompanying work, we find that two orientational distributions are necessary to fit the WAXS data at lower temperatures, whereas only one distribution is needed at temperatures higher than the miscibility transition temperature, T(mix) = 25-35 degrees C (for 1:1 DOPC/DPPC with 15\%, 20\%, 25\%, and 30\% Chol). We propose that the necessity for two distributions is a criterion for coexistence of Lo domains with a high S(x-ray) order parameter and Ld domains with a lower order parameter. This criterion is capable of detecting coexistence of small domains or rafts that the conventional x-ray criterion of two lamellar D spacings may not. Our T(mix) values tend to be slightly larger than published NMR results and microscopy results when the fluorescence probe artifact is considered. This is consistent with the sensitivity of WAXS to very short time and length scales, which makes it more capable of detecting small, short-lived domains that are likely close to T(mix).},

Here, the pulsed electronelectron double resonance technique was used to obtain unique conformational information on the aggregated peptide in the lipid membrane-bound state. Since a specific helical conformation implies a given length to the peptide molecule, a distance r was measured at the nanometer scale via the electron dipoledipole interaction between two 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-4-amino-4-carboxylic acid spin labels synthetically incorporated at positions 1 and 16 of this 19-mer peptide. Two data sets were collected (at 77 K): (i) from aggregates of Alm in hydrated egg-yolk phosphocholine (ePC) vesicles (at peptide-to-lipid ratios of 1:200 and 1:75) and (ii) from nonaggregated Alm in pure (nonhydrated) ePC and in solvents of different polarity. The intramolecular distance between the two labels obtained in this manner is in excellent agreement with that calculated on the basis of an almost fully developed ÃÂ±-helical conformation for this peptide and is found to be independent of the molecular aggregated state and the environment polarity as well.},

Apparent donor numbers for anions dissolved in various solvents other than dce (DN(X,solv)) are also given and used to show that the donor properties of anions are directly related to the acceptor number (AN(solv)) of the solvent. This arises from competition between solvent and acceptor ion for the anion leading to a steady decrease in the effective donor number of the anion as AN(solv) increases, culminating in an effective donor number of zero for all anions in the strong acceptor solvent water (ion pairing is at a minimum in water). The values of the anion donor numbers are related to some experimental results such as spectral, equilibrium, kinetic and thermodynamic data for selected systems. This method of establishing donor numbers for anions is shown to be reliable and easy to apply.}

Enthalpies of complexation are also reported for two silver ion cryptates. The results are combined with previously determined free energies of complexation to obtain the corresponding entropies. In dipolar aprotic solvents, the enthalpies of transfer of the complexes are very similar to those of the free ligands, so that changes in enthalpies of complexation are dominated by the enthalpies of solvation of the silver cation. The thermodynamics of ligation, i.e., of complex formation between the gaseous silver ion and the diaza-crown and cryptand ligands in solution, are calculated and, for the free energies, partitioned into contributions from each of the donor atoms (N, O, and S). Among the aprotic solvents, contributions of oxygen and sulphur atoms in the ligand bridges to the stabilities of diaza-crown and cryptand complexes are additive and independent of solvent. In methanol, hydrogen bonding between methanol molecules and the free ligands reduces the magnitudes of both the free energies and enthalpies of formation of the silver complexes.}

  Abstract                 = {The visual pigment rhodopsin is a prototypical member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. In this study, we have investigated the effect of a series of n-alcohols on the formation of metarhodopsin II (MII), the photoactivated conformation of rhodopsin, which binds and activates transducin. When rhodopsin was photolyzed in the presence of several n-alcohols, increased MII formation was observed in the order ethanol > butanol > hexanol, whereas longer chain n-alcohols inhibited MII formation with decanol > octanol. The magnitude of the stimulatory effects was greater in a more highly unsaturated phospholipid. Alcohols, which enhanced MII formation also increased phospholipid acyl chain packing free volume, while those that decreased this bilayer property inhibited MII formation. An apparent discontinuity in the effect of these alcohols results when their potency is calculated in terms of the total aqueous alcohol concentration. In sharp contrast, a continuous variation in their behavior is observed, when their potency is calculated in terms of the amount of alcohol partitioned in the membrane. Our findings strongly support a lipid-mediated mechanism of action for alcohols on rhodopsin and, by analogy, for other G protein-coupled receptors.},

The equilibrium concentration of MII, the G protein-activating form of photoactivated rhodopsin, was found to increase as a function of ethanol concentration in all three bilayers.

The effects of ethanol on lipid acyl chain packing in POPC and PDPC were investigated using frequency domain anisotropy decay measurements of the fluorescent membrane probe 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene. Enhanced formation of MII due to the presence of ethanol was correlated with the effects of ethanol on acyl chain packing properties.

  Abstract                 = {Neutral solutes were used to investigate the effects of osmotic stress both on the ability of rhodopsin to undergo its activating conformation change and on acyl chain packing in the rod outer segment (ROS) disk membrane. The equilibrium concentration of metarhodopsin II (MII), the conformation of photoactivated rhodopsin, which binds and activates transducin, was increased by glycerol, sucrose, and stachyose in a manner which was linear with osmolality. Analysis of this shift in equilibrium in terms of the dependence of ln(Keq) on osmolality revealed that 20 +/- 1 water molecules are released during the MI-to-MII transition at 20 degrees C, and at 35 degrees C 13 +/- 1 waters are released. At 35 degrees C the average time constant for MII formation was increased from 1.20 +/- 0.09 ms to 1.63 +/- 0.09 ms by addition of 1 osmolal sucrose or glycerol. The effect of the neutral solutes on acyl chain packing in the ROS disk membrane was assessed via measurements of the fluorescence lifetime and anisotropy decay of 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH). Analysis of the anisotropy decay of DPH in terms of the rotational diffusion model showed that the angular width of the equilibrium orientational distribution of DPH about the membrane normal was progressively narrowed by increased osmolality. The parameter fv, which is proportional to the overlap between the DPH orientational probability distribution and a random orientational distribution, was reduced by the osmolytes in a manner which was linear with osmolality. This study highlights the potentially opposing interplay between the effect of membrane surface hydration on both the lipid bilayer and integral membrane protein structure. Our results further demonstrate that the binding and release of water molecules play an important role in modulating functional conformational changes for integral membrane proteins, as well as for soluble globular proteins.},

The ethanol-induced increase in MII formation was amplified by the addition of neutral osmolytes. This enhancement was linear with osmolality. At 360 milliosmolal, the osmolality of human plasma, 50 mM ethanol was 2.7 times more potent than at 0 osmolality, demonstrating the importance of water activity in in vitro experiments dealing with ethanol potency. Ethanol disordered acyl chain packing, and increasing osmolality enhanced this acyl chain disordering. Prior osmotic stress data showed a release of 35 +/- 2 water molecules upon MII formation. Ethanol increases this number to 49 water molecules, suggesting that ethanol replaces 15 additional water molecules upon MII formation. Amplification of ethanol effects on MII formation and acyl chain packing by osmolytes suggests that ethanol increases the equilibrium concentration of MII both by disordering acyl chain packing and by disrupting rhodopsin-water hydrogen bonds, demonstrating a direct effect of ethanol on rhodopsin. At physiologically relevant levels of osmolality and ethanol, about 90\% of ethanol's effect is due to disordered acyl chain packing.},

  abstract =    {In this study, we applied a comprehensive G protein-coupled receptor-GÎ±i protein chemical cross-linking strategy to map the cannabinoid receptor subtype 2 (CB2)- GÎ±i interface and then used molecular dynamics simulations to explore the dynamics of complex formation. Three cross-link sites were identified using LC-MS/MS and electrospray ionization-MS/MS as follows: 1) a sulfhydryl cross-link between C3.53(134) in TMH3 and the GÎ±i C-terminal i-3 residue Cys-351; 2) a lysine cross-link between K6.35(245) in TMH6 and the GÎ±i C-terminal i-5 residue, Lys-349; and 3) a lysine cross-link between K5.64(215) in TMH5 and the GÎ±i Î±4Î²6 loop residue, Lys-317. To investigate the dynamics and nature of the conformational changes involved in CB2Â·Gi complex formation, we carried out microsecond-time scale molecular dynamics simulations of the CB2 R*Â·GÎ±i1Î²1Î³2 complex embedded in a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine bilayer, using cross-linking information as validation. Our results show that although molecular dynamics simulations started with the G protein orientation in the Î²2-AR*Â·GÎ±sÎ²1Î³2 complex crystal structure, the GÎ±i1Î²1Î³2 protein reoriented itself within 300 ns. Two major changes occurred as follows. 1) The GÎ±i1 Î±5 helix tilt changed due to the outward movement of TMH5 in CB2 R*. 2) A 25Â° clockwise rotation of GÎ±i1Î²1Î³2 underneath CB2 R* occurred, with rotation ceasing when Pro-139 (IC-2 loop) anchors in a hydrophobic pocket on GÎ±i1 (Val-34, Leu-194, Phe-196, Phe-336, Thr-340, Ile-343, and Ile-344). In this complex, all three experimentally identified cross-links can occur. These findings should be relevant for other class A G protein-coupled receptors that couple to Gi proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Despite the large amount of experimental data accumulated in the past decade on G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) structure and function, understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying GPCR signaling is still far from being complete, thus impairing the design of effective and selective pharmaceuticals. OBJECTIVE: Understanding of GPCR function has been challenged even further by more recent experimental evidence that several of these receptors are organized in the cell membrane as homo- or hetero-oligomers, and that they may exhibit unique pharmacological properties. Given the complexity of these new signaling systems, researcher's efforts are turning increasingly to molecular modeling, bioinformatics and computational simulations for mechanistic insights of GPCR functional plasticity. METHODS: We review here current advances in the development and application of computational approaches to improve prediction of GPCR structure and dynamics, thus enhancing current understanding of GPCR signaling. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Models resulting from use of these computational approaches further supported by experiments are expected to help elucidate the complex allosterism that propagates through GPCR complexes, ultimately aiming at successful structure-based rational drug design.},

The k(q) values for different diol-CA pairs are seen to increase as the oxidation potential of the diol becomes less positive or the reduction potential of the CA becomes less negative, indicating the electron transfer (ET) type of interaction for the observed quenching. Following Marcus' outer-sphere ET theory, the correlation of the observed k(q) values with the free-energy changes for such reactions (DeltaG(0)) results in the recovery of an unusually higher intramolecular reorganization energy (lambda(in)), indicating that the ET in the systems studied might not be of outer sphere in nature. Since the CAs are prone to undergo C-Cl bond cleavage following their reduction, a dissociative ET (DET) mechanism has been proposed for the observed fluorescence quenching. The evidence for the DET mechanism has been obtained by characterizing and estimating the Cl- ions in the photolyzed diol-CA solutions. Following a suitable theory for concerted DET reactions, it is seen that the observed k(q) values correlate well with the free-energy changes (DeltaG(DET)(0)) for such reactions. It is seen that the reorganization energy recovered from such correlation accounts well for the C-Cl bond dissociation energy of the CAs, supporting a concerted DET mechanism in these systems.

  abstract =    {The interpretation of experimental observations of the dependence of membrane protein function on the properties of the lipid membrane environment calls for a consideration of the energy cost of protein-bilayer interactions, including the protein-bilayer hydrophobic mismatch. We present a novel (to our knowledge) multiscale computational approach for quantifying the hydrophobic mismatch-driven remodeling of membrane bilayers by multihelical membrane proteins. The method accounts for both the membrane remodeling energy and the energy contribution from any partial (incomplete) alleviation of the hydrophobic mismatch by membrane remodeling. Overcoming previous limitations, it allows for radially asymmetric bilayer deformations produced by multihelical proteins, and takes into account the irregular membrane-protein boundaries. The approach is illustrated by application to two G-protein coupled receptors: rhodopsin in bilayers of different thickness, and the serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor bound to pharmacologically different ligands. Analysis of the results identifies the residual exposure that is not alleviated by bilayer adaptation, and its quantification at specific transmembrane segments is shown to predict favorable contact interfaces in oligomeric arrays. In addition, our results suggest how distinct ligand-induced conformations of G-protein coupled receptors may elicit different functional responses through differential effects on the membrane environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Many observations of the role of the membrane in the function and organization of transmembrane (TM) proteins have been explained in terms of hydrophobic mismatch between the membrane and the inserted protein. For a quantitative investigation of this mechanism in the lipid-protein interactions of functionally relevant conformations adopted by a multi-TM segment protein, the bacterial leucine transporter (LeuT), we employed a novel method, Continuum-Molecular Dynamics (CTMD), that quantifies the energetics of hydrophobic mismatch by combining the elastic continuum theory of membrane deformations with an atomistic level description of the radially asymmetric membrane-protein interface from MD simulations. LeuT has been serving as a model for structure-function studies of the mammalian neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSSs), such as the dopamine and serotonin transporters, which are the subject of intense research in the field of neurotransmission. The membrane models in which LeuT was embedded for these studies were composed of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) lipid, or 3:1 mixture of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoglycerol (POPG) lipids. The results show that deformation of the host membrane alone is not sufficient to alleviate the hydrophobic mismatch at specific residues of LeuT. The calculations reveal significant membrane thinning and water penetration due to the specific local polar environment produced by the charged K288 of TM7 in LeuT, that is membrane-facing deep inside the hydrophobic milieu of the membrane. This significant perturbation is shown to result in unfavorable polar-hydrophobic interactions at neighboring hydrophobic residues in TM1a and TM7. We show that all the effects attributed to the K288 residue (membrane thinning, water penetration, and the unfavorable polar-hydrophobic interactions at TM1a and TM7), are abolished in calculations with the K288A mutant. The involvement of hydrophobic mismatch is somewhat different in the functionally distinct conformations (outward-open, occluded, inward-open) of LeuT, and the differences are shown to connect to structural elements (e.g., TM1a) known to play key roles in transport. This finding suggests a mechanistic hypothesis for the enhanced transport activity observed for the K288A mutant, suggesting that the unfavorable hydrophobic-hydrophilic interactions hinder the motion of TM1a in the functionally relevant conformational transition to the inward-open state. Various extents of such unfavorable interactions, involving exposure to the lipid environment of adjacent hydrophobic and polar residues, are common in multi-segment transmembrane proteins, and must be considered to affect functionally relevant conformational transitions.},

  Abstract                 = {Very large molecular systems can be calculated with the so called CNDOL approximate Hamiltonians that have been developed by avoiding oversimplifications and only using a priori parameters and formulas from the simpler NDO methods. A new diagonal monoelectronic term named CNDOL/21 shows great consistency and easier SCF convergence when used together with an appropriate function for charge repulsion energies that is derived from traditional formulas. It is possible to obtain a priori molecular orbitals and electron excitation properties after the configuration interaction of single excited determinants with reliability, maintaining interpretative possibilities even being a simplified Hamiltonian. Tests with some unequivocal gas phase maxima of simple molecules (benzene, furfural, acetaldehyde, hexyl alcohol, methyl amine, 2,5 dimethyl 2,4 hexadiene, and ethyl sulfide) ratify the general quality of this approach in comparison with other methods. The calculation of large systems as porphine in gas phase and a model of the complete retinal binding pocket in rhodopsin with 622 basis functions on 280 atoms at the quantum mechanical level show reliability leading to a resulting first allowed transition in 483 nm, very similar to the known experimental value of 500 nm of "dark state." In this very important case, our model gives a central role in this excitation to a charge transfer from the neighboring Glu(-) counterion to the retinaldehyde polyene chain. Tests with gas phase maxima of some important molecules corroborate the reliability of CNDOL/2 Hamiltonians.},

On the computational side, efficient sampling of the configuration space along the transition pathway remains the most daunting challenge. Recognizing this issue, we introduce a knowledge-based computational approach toward describing large-scale conformational transitions using (i) nonequilibrium, driven simulations combined with work measurements and (ii) free energy calculations using empirically optimized biasing protocols. The first part is based on designing mechanistically relevant, system-specific reaction coordinates whose usefulness and applicability in inducing the transition of interest are examined using knowledge-based, qualitative assessments along with nonequilirbrium work measurements which provide an empirical framework for optimizing the biasing protocol. The second part employs the optimized biasing protocol resulting from the first part to initiate free energy calculations and characterize the transition quantitatively. Using a biasing protocol fine-tuned to a particular transition not only improves the accuracy of the resulting free energies but also speeds up the convergence. The efficiency of the sampling will be assessed by employing dimensionality reduction techniques to help detect possible flaws and provide potential improvements in the design of the biasing protocol. Structural transition of a membrane transporter will be used as an example to illustrate the workings of the proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Deuterated water associated with oriented POPC bilayers was investigated before and after the addition of 2 mol\% peptide. Membranes in the presences of antimicrobial-(LAH4), pore-forming- (the segments M2 of influenza A and S4 of the domain I of rat brain sodium channels) or lysine-containing model peptides (LAK1 and LAK3) were investigated by (2)H and proton-decoupled (31)P solid-state NMR. The NMR spectra were recorded as a function of hydration in the range between 15 and 93\% relative humidity and of sample composition. In the presence of peptides an increased association of water is observed. A quantitative analysis suggests that the peptide-induced changes in the lipid bilayer packing have a significant effect on membrane-water association. The quadrupolar splittings of (2)H(2)O at a given degree of hydration indicate that the changes of the water deuterium order parameter are specific for the peptide sequence and the lipid composition.},

  Abstract                 = {Coarse-graining of protein interactions provides a means of simulating large biological systems. Here, a coarse-graining method, REACH, is introduced, in which the force constants of a residue-scale elastic network model are calculated from the variance-covariance matrix obtained from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. In test calculations, the C(alpha)-atoms variance-covariance matrices are calculated from the ensembles of 1-ns atomistic MD trajectories in monomeric and dimeric myoglobin, and used to derive coarse-grained force constants for the local and nonbonded interactions. Construction of analytical model functions of the distance-dependence of the interresidue force constants allows rapid calculation of the REACH normal modes. The model force constants from monomeric and dimeric myoglobin are found to be similar in magnitude to each other. The MD intra- and intermolecular mean-square fluctuations and the vibrational density of states are well reproduced by the residue-scale REACH normal modes without requiring rescaling of the force constant parameters. The temperature-dependence of the myoglobin REACH force constants reveals that the dynamical transition in protein internal fluctuations arises principally from softening of the elasticity in the nonlocal interactions. The REACH method is found to be a reliable way of determining spatiotemporal protein motion without the need for expensive computations of long atomistic MD simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {Coarse graining of protein interactions provides a means of simulating large biological systems. The REACH (Realistic Extension Algorithm via Covariance Hessian) coarse-graining method, in which the force constants of a residue-scale elastic network model are calculated from the variance-covariance matrix obtained from atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, involves direct mapping between scales without the need for iterative optimization. Here, the transferability of the REACH force field is examined between protein molecules of different structural classes. As test cases, myoglobin (all alpha), plastocyanin (all beta), and dihydrofolate reductase (alpha/beta) are taken. The force constants derived are found to be closely similar in all three proteins. An MD version of REACH is presented, and low-temperature coarse-grained (CG) REACH MD simulations of the three proteins are compared with atomistic MD results. The mean-square fluctuations of the atomistic MD are well reproduced by the CGMD. Model functions for the CG interactions, derived by averaging over the three proteins, are also shown to produce fluctuations in good agreement with the atomistic MD. The results indicate that, similarly to the use of atomistic force fields, it is now possible to use a single, generic REACH force field for all protein studies, without having first to derive parameters from atomistic MD simulation for each individual system studied. The REACH method is thus likely to be a reliable way of determining spatiotemporal motion of a variety of proteins without the need for expensive computation of long atomistic MD simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {Ligands for several transcription factors can act as agonists under some conditions and antagonists under others. The structural and molecular bases of such effects are unknown. Previously, we demonstrated how the folding of intrinsically disordered (ID) protein sequences, in particular, and population shifts, in general, could be used to mediate allosteric coupling between different functional domains, a model that has subsequently been validated in several systems. Here it is shown that population redistribution within allosteric systems can be used as a mechanism to tune protein ensembles such that a given ligand can act as both an agonist and an antagonist. Importantly, this mechanism can be robustly encoded in the ensemble, and does not require that the interactions between the ligand and the protein differ when it is acting either as an agonist or an antagonist. Instead, the effect is due to the relative probabilities of states prior to the addition of the ligand. The ensemble view of allostery that is illuminated by these studies suggests that rather than being seen as switches with fixed responses to allosteric activation, ensembles can evolve to be "functionally pluripotent," with the capacity to up or down regulate activity in response to a stimulus. This result not only helps to explain the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in transcription factors and other cell signaling proteins, it provides important insights about the energetic ground rules governing site-to-site communication in all allosteric systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Allostery is a biological phenomenon of critical importance in metabolic regulation and cell signalling. The fundamental premise of classical models that describe allostery is that structure mediates 'action at a distance'. Recently, this paradigm has been challenged by the enrichment of IDPs (intrinsically disordered proteins) or ID (intrinsically disordered) segments in transcription factors and signalling pathways of higher organisms, where an allosteric response from external signals is requisite for regulated function. This observation strongly suggests that IDPs elicit the capacity for finely tunable allosteric regulation. Is there a set of transferable ground rules that reconcile these disparate allosteric phenomena? We focus on findings from the human GR (glucocorticoid receptor) which is a nuclear transcription factor in the SHR (steroid hormone receptor) family. GR contains an intrinsically disordered NTD (N-terminal domain) that is obligatory for transcription activity. Different GR translational isoforms have various lengths of NTD and by studying these isoforms we found that the full-length ID NTD consists of two thermodynamically distinct coupled regions. The data are interpreted in the context of an EAM (ensemble allosteric model) that considers only the intrinsic and measurable energetics of allosteric systems. Expansion of the EAM is able to reconcile the paradox that ligands for SHRs can be agonists and antagonists in a cell-context-dependent manner. These findings suggest a mechanism by which SHRs in particular, and IDPs in general, may have evolved to couple thermodynamically distinct ID segments. The ensemble view of allostery that is illuminated provides organizing principles to unify the description of all allosteric systems and insight into 'how' allostery works.},

Results for ions in pure water and pure acetonitrile are presented for ambient conditions. The degree of association is law in water, a high-density fluid, and high in acetonitrile, a low-density: fluid. A separate set of simulations for water at supercritical temperatures demonstrates that the fluid density is more important than the temperature in deter mining the degree of ion association. Preliminary results for the mixtures are inconclusive except that they indicate the existence of an important sampling issue related to the compositional heterogeneity of the mixtures.

Among such proteins, class A G protein-coupled receptors have become amenable to crystallization and high resolution X-ray diffraction analyses. The derived structures of native and engineered receptors not only provide insights into their molecular arrangements but also furnish a framework for designing and testing potential models of transformation from inactive to active receptor signaling states and for initiating rational drug design.},

Here we describe plectasin-the first defensin to be isolated from a fungus, the saprophytic ascomycete Pseudoplectania nigrella. Plectasin has primary, secondary and tertiary structures that closely resemble those of defensins found in spiders, scorpions, dragonflies and mussels. Recombinant plectasin was produced at a very high, and commercially viable, yield and purity. In vitro, the recombinant peptide was especially active against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including strains resistant to conventional antibiotics. Plectasin showed extremely low toxicity in mice, and cured them of experimental peritonitis and pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae as efficaciously as vancomycin and penicillin. These findings identify fungi as a novel source of antimicrobial defensins, and show the therapeutic potential of plectasin. They also suggest that the defensins of insects, molluscs and fungi arose from a common ancestral gene.},

  Abstract                 = {The quantitative experimental uncertainty in the structure of fully hydrated, biologically relevant, fluid (L(alpha)) phase lipid bilayers has been too large to provide a firm base for applications or for comparison with simulations. Many structural methods are reviewed including modern liquid crystallography of lipid bilayers that deals with the fully developed undulation fluctuations that occur in the L(alpha) phase. These fluctuations degrade the higher order diffraction data in a way that, if unrecognized, leads to erroneous conclusions regarding bilayer structure. Diffraction measurements at high instrumental resolution provide a measure of these fluctuations. In addition to providing better structural determination, this opens a new window on interactions between bilayers, so the experimental determination of interbilayer interaction parameters is reviewed briefly. We introduce a new structural correction based on fluctuations that has not been included in any previous studies. Updated measurements, such as for the area compressibility modulus, are used to provide adjustments to many of the literature values of structural quantities. Since the gel (L(beta)') phase is valuable as a stepping stone for obtaining fluid phase results, a brief review is given of the lower temperature phases. The uncertainty in structural results for lipid bilayers is being reduced and best current values are provided for bilayers of five lipids.},

Transfer thermodynamic parameters of these ligands to various solvents show that these macrocycles undergo selective solvation in nonaqueous media. As far as the alkali-metal cations are concerned, 1H NMR measurements reflect that 1 in CD3CN discriminates against the largest cations (K+, Rb+, and Cs+) but interacts with Li+ and Na+. These interactions appears to be more pronounced with the pendent arms containing the pyridyl ring (through the ethereal oxygens and nitrogen donor atoms) than with those containing the (methylthio)ethoxy arms (only ethereal oxygens are involved). No interaction takes place between its isomer 2 and alkali-metal cations in CD3CN. The complexation of the lithium and the sodium complexes was established through conductometric titrations. In all cases investigated 1: 1 (ligand: metal cation) complexes are formed in acetonitrile and in benzonitrile. On the basis of the semiquantitative information provided by conductance measurements regarding the strength of complexation of I and the sodium cation, the sodium monoacetonitrile complex of I was isolated and its structure determined by X-ray diffraction methods. Thus, the cation was found in the hydrophilic cavity while the hydrophobic cavity hosts a molecule of acetonitrile. The crystallographic results confirm the key role played in the chelating process by the ethereal oxygens and the pyridyl nitrogens at the 2-position in the terminal pyridyl groups, as found in solution. The thermodynamics of complexation of I and alkali-metal cations (Li+ and Na+) in two dipolar aprotic solvents is interpreted in terms of the solution thermodynamics of the reactants and the product. It is the availability of these data that allows interpreting the different enthalpic and entropic contributions resulting from cation, solvent, and ligand effects. Final conclusions are given.},

H-1 NMR experiments were carried out by adding to the ligand an excess amount of the appropriate metal cation (Li+, Na+, K+) in CD3CN at 298 K. Measurements were taken at different time intervals ranging from 30 min to 10 days. It was found that the kinetics of the process in this solvent is fast. Conductance measurements demonstrated that 1 :1 metal cation :ligand stoichiometries are found with these cations in these solvents. Thermodynamic parameters of complexation for this ligand and alkali-metal cations in acetonitrile and in benzonitrile at 295.15 K were derived from titration microcalorimetry. Stability constants were also determined by the competitive potentiometric method using silver electrodes. Excellent agreement is found between the data derived from calorimetry and those derived by potentiometry. The highest stability is found for lithium with this ligand. The results are compared with data previously reported for systems involving a calix(4)arene ester derivative and these cations in the same solvents. The implications of stability constant data on the selective behaviour of this ligand for metal cations in these solvents are discussed. It is shown that this ligand in these solvents is able to discriminate between the smaller cations (Li+ and Na+) and the larger ones (K+ and Rb+). The sodium perchlorate complex of 1a was synthesised and the molecular structure of this complex has been determined from X-ray diffraction data. The substance crystallises in the tetragonal group P4cc with a = 21.791(2), c = 26.958(3) Angstrom, and z = 8. There are three different complexes in the lattice, two sited on fourfold axes and a third one on a twofold axis. All ligands exhibit a 'cone' conformation and the Na+ ion is encapsulated in their hydrophilic pockets with an acetonitrile molecule filling their hydrophobic cavities. Based on H-1 NMR, conductimetric, microcalorimetric and X-ray diffraction studies final conclusions are given.},

Using silver electrodes, direct potentiometric titrations were carried out at 298.15 K to derive the stability constants of these ligands and the silver cation in these solvents.

The extraction properties of calix[4]arene amine derivatives for the silver cation was investigated, from distribution data for silver(i) in the water-nitrobenzene solvent system at 298.15 K in the absence and in the presence of the ligand. Distribution data in the absence of the ligand were used to derive the partition, K-p, and the distribution, K-d, equilibrium constants for the silver(i) perchlorate in the mutually saturated solvents as well as the ion-pair formation constant, K-a, for this salt in nitrobenzene (saturated with water). K-d values were also obtained from distribution data for the silver salt in the presence of five different ligands. Equilibrium extraction constants, K-ex, for the various ligands also derived from these data are reported.

Thus, detailed thermodynamics of this system are first reported taking into account the solution properties of the reactants and the product in various solvents with the aim of assessing quantitatively the medium effect on the complexation process. The sodium: monoacetonitrile : 1 complex was isolated and its molecular structure was determinated from X-ray diffraction data. The calix now adopts a more symmetric cone conformation than the free ligand and its hydrophobic cavity is filled with an acetonitrile solvent molecule. The hydrophilic pocket hosts the sodium canon which is in an eight-fold coordination with the. four ethereal oxygen atoms [average d(Na-O) = 2.45(4) Angstrom] and the four carbonyl oxygen atoms [average d(Na-O) = 2.51(4) Angstrom] forming the corners of a distorted Archimedean square antiprism. The key structural features relevant to the complexation process are discussed. H- 1 NMR and conductance measurements have been used to assess the interaction of 1 and 2 with alkali metal cations. Final conclusions are given. Attention is drawn about the relevance of detailed thermodynamic studies on cation complexation processes involving calixarene derivatives. This is discussed within the context of selectivity and the factors controlling it in solution processes.},

Stability constants were determined potentiometrically by the use of a sodium selective electrode with the silver/silver (I) reference electrode. A linear relationship is found between the stability constant and the solvent composition. The strength of complexation decreases from acetonitrile through the mixtures. The minimum stability for this system was found in N,N- dimethylformamide. The striking feature of these data are the small variations in enthalpy observed in the solvent mixtures relative to their pure solvents. In all cases, the complexation process in these solvent mixtures is enthalpically controlled. However, the higher stability found by increasing the content of acetonitrile in the mixture is accompanied by an increase of entropy. Standard enthalpies of solution of the reactants (NaClO4 and ligand) and the product (metal-ion complex) are reported. These data are used to calculate the standard coordination enthalpies as a means of checking the reliability of the data. Transfer enthalpy data from acetonitrile are calculated in an attempt to establish the factors which contribute to the enthalpies of complexation in the mixed solvents relative to corresponding data in the pure solvents. The exothermic character of the transfer process involving the sodium complex electrolyte increases as the content of DMF in the mixture increases but Delta H-t degrees from acetonitrile to neat DMF became less negative. The H-1 NMR study carried out in CD3CN, d(7) - DMF and mixed solvents shows that the interaction between these two solvents enhances the interaction of the molecule of acetonitrile through its methyl group with the hydrophobic cavity of the complex. This explains the gain in the enthalpic stability observed in the transfer of the sodium complex salt from acetonitrile to the mixtures.},

Solvation effects are assessed from the standard transfer Gibbs energies of these ligands, using acetonitrile as the reference solvent. For the 2-pyridyl derivative in alcohols as the aliphatic chain length of the alcohol increases, the extent of solvent-ligand interaction increases, whereas for the 3- and the 4-pyridyl derivatives the opposite is observed. The protonation constants for the 4-pyridyl derivative in methanol at 298.15 K are reported. The results, compared with corresponding values for the 3-pyridyl derivative show that the basic character of these ligands follows the sequence; 4-pyridyl > 3-pyridyl > 2-pyridyl calix(4)arene. Thermodynamic parameters for the complexation of these macrocycles (2 and 4-pyridyl derivatives) and the silver cation in acetonitrile show that, as the distance between the phenolic oxygens and the pyridyl nitrogens increases, the strength of complexation decreases. Thermodynamic data for the complexation of silver and the 2-pyridylcalix(4)arene derivative are compared with corresponding values for sodium and this ligand in the same solvent. The results suggest that the 2-pyridyl derivative provides phenolic oxygens and pyridyl nitrogens as the active sites for complexation with silver. This is corroborated by H-1 NMR measurements of this ligand and silver in CD3CN at 298 K. The crystal, structure of a 1 : 1 monoacetonitrile and silver complex of the 2-pyridyl derivative with perchlorate as the counter-ion has been determined from XRD data. The substance crystallises in the tetragonal space group P4/n with a = 15.580(2) Angstrom, c = 13.082(2) Angstrom, and z = 2. The macrocycle is sited on a fourfold symmetry axis and consists of two conical parts, one hydrophobic, filled with an acetonitrile molecule, the other hydrophilic, encapsulating the Ag+ ion through the ethereal oxygen [d(Ag ... O) = 2.923(3) Angstrom] and pyridine nitrogen atoms [d(Ag ... N) = 2.483(5) Angstrom]. The coordination around the Ag+ ion has the form of a distorted Archimedean square antiprism.

From distribution data, the partition and the distribution constants of these salts in this solvent system and the ion-pair formation constants of alkali metal picrates in water saturated dichloromethane were calculated. For salts containing the smaller alkali metal cations, significant differences were found between the partition and the transfer Gibbs energies in this solvent system. The former data are referred to the mutually saturated solvents whereas the latter involve water and dichloromethane in their pure state. In order to (i) formulate an equation which is representative of the extraction process taking place when an aqueous solution containing the free metal ion salt is equilibrated with a solution of calixarene ester in dichloromethane and (ii) gain information regarding the behaviour of calixarene ester salts in non-aqueousmedia, conductance measurements were performed in acetonitrile and pure and wet dichloromethane at 298.15 K.Whenever possible, the ion-pair formation constants and the limiting molar conductances were calculated from the analysis of data using a well established treatment. The results obtained are discussed. From distribution experiments in the presence of ethyl p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene tetraethanoate in the mutually saturated solvents, the distribution and extraction constants for alkali metal picrates were calculated. Good agreement was found between the distribution constants derived from data in the absence and presence of the ligand. The individual processes involved in the overall extraction of cations by ethyl p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene tetraethanoate were assessed. The results were compared with corresponding data for the mutually saturated water-benzonitrile solvent system. It is concluded that the higher extraction constants obtained in the latter solvent system are mainly attributed to the more favourable distribution constants in water-benzonitrile relative to water-dichloromethane. Based on the experimental evidence shown in this paper, some of the statements made in the literature regarding these systems are discussed. The effect of the solvent on the selective extraction of alkali metal cations from water is discussed.},

Comparison of data involving lithium and the calix(4)arene ester and the cryptand 222 with those for crown ethers reflects considerable weakening of cation-anion interactions in the former ligands relative to crown ethers. It is concluded that for a given ligand and metal cation, the anion effect is reflected in the co-ordination enthalpies. On the other hand, for systems containing the same ligand and anion, there is a decrease in enthalpic stability in moving from lithium to sodium. The need to obtain experimental data on crystal lattice enthalpies of these ligands and their metal ion complex salts is emphasised.},

Conductometric titrations of Ag+ and this ligand in methanol and in ethanol indicate that the stoichiometry of the metal ion-ligand complex is 1:1. The thermodynamics of complexation of 1a and silver in six different solvents (methanol, ethanol, propan-1-ol, N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, and benzonitrile) at 298.15 K was derived from titration calorimetry. Stability constants were also checked by direct potentiometry using silver electrodes.

These data are combined with corresponding Gibbs energies to derive the transfer entropies of this ligand to the various solvents. The data indicate that the transfer of the ligand from the reference solvent to another leads to more pronounced enthalpy and entropy changes (variations of up to 16 kJ mol(-1) and 37 J K-1 mol(-1), respectively) than those observed in the corresponding Gibbs energy. The standard enthalpies of solution of the free and the complexed silver perchlorate salts have been also measured calorimetrically in various solvents, and the enthalpy of coordination of this system referred to the process in the solid state has been calculated. A few representative examples about the use of coordination data are given. The medium effect on the thermodynamics of the complexation process in two solvents is analyzed in terms of the contributions of the enthalpies and entropies of transfer of the free and the complexed metal cation and the ligand from acetonitrile to the appropriate solvent.

Here, a method to simulate the folding process of a protein to its native state is reported, the essential dynamics sampling (EDS) method, and is successfully applied to detecting the correct folding pathways of two small proteins, the all-ÃÂ² SH3 domain of Src tyrosine kinase transforming protein (SH3) and the ÃÂ±/ÃÂ² B1 domain of streptococcal protein G (GB1). The main idea of the method is that a subset of the natural modes of fluctuation in the native state is key in directing the folding process. A biased molecular dynamics simulation is performed, in which the restrained degrees of freedom are chosen among those obtained by a principal component, or essential dynamics, analysis of the positional fluctuations of the CÃÂ± atoms in the native state. Successful folding is obtained if the restraints are applied only to the eigenvectors with lowest eigenvalues, representing the most rigid quasi-constraint motions. If the essential eigenvectors, the ones accounting for most of the variance, are used, folding is not successful. These results clearly show that the eigenvectors with lowest eigenvalues contain the main mechanical information necessary to drive the folding process, while the essential eigenvectors represent the large concerted motions which can occur without folding/unfolding the protein.},

These results indicate that the electron-transfer or charge-transfer type of interaction is operative in these systems. In less polar solvents, such as cyclohexane and ethyl acetate, weak exciplex formation between the S-1 state of the phenothiazines and the chloroalkanes has been observed, whereas in a more polar solvent, such as acetonitrile, direct electron transfer takes place from the S-1 state of the phenothiazines to the chloroalkanes, leading to dissociation of the C-X bond of chloroalkanes. Picosecond flash photolysis studies carried out on these systems showed the presence of the cation radical of the phenothiazines and support the photoinduced charge separation and other processes proposed.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose classifying surfactants with respect to their effect on membrane order, which is derived from the time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy of DPH. This may help in understanding why certain surfactants, including biosurfactants such as antimicrobial lipopeptides and saponins, often show a superior performance to permeabilize and lyse membranes and/or a better suitability for membrane protein solubilization. Micelle-forming surfactants induce curvature stress in membranes that causes disordering and, finally, lysis. Typical detergents such as C(12)EO(8), octyl glucoside, SDS, and lauryl maltoside initiate membrane lysis after reaching a substantial, apparently critical extent of disordering. In contrast, the fungicidal lipopeptides surfactin, fengycin, and iturin from Bacillus subtilis QST713 as well as digitonin, CHAPS, and lysophosphatidylcholine solubilize membranes without substantial, overall disordering. We hypothesize they disrupt the membrane locally due to a spontaneous segregation from the lipid and/or packing defects and refer to them as heterogeneously perturbing. This may account for enhanced activity, selectivity, and mutual synergism of antimicrobial biosurfactants and reduced destabilization of membrane proteins by CHAPS or digitonin. Triton shows the pattern of a segregating surfactant in the presence of cholesterol.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, atomistic molecular simulations have become a method of choice for studying the interaction of small molecules, peptides, and proteins with biological membranes. Here, we critically examine the statistical convergence of equilibrium properties in molecular simulations of two amino acid side-chain analogs, leucine and arginine, in the presence of a hydrated phospholipid bilayer. To this end, the convergence of the standard binding free energy for the reversible insertion of the solutes in the bilayer is systematically assessed by evaluating dozens of separate sets of umbrella sampling calculations for a total simulation time exceeding 400 mu s. We identify rare and abrupt transitions in bilayer structure as a function of solute insertion depth. These transitions correspond to the slow reorganization of ionic interactions involving zwitterionic phospholipid headgroups when the solutes penetrate the lipid water interface and when arginine is forced through the bilayer center. These rare events are shown to constitute hidden sampling barriers that limit the rate of convergence of equilibrium properties and result in systematic sampling errors. Our analysis demonstrates that the difficulty of attaining convergence for lipid bilayer-embedded solutes has, in general, been drastically underestimated. This information will assist future studies in improving accuracy by selecting a more appropriate reaction coordinate or by focusing computational resources on those regions of the reaction coordinate that exhibit slow convergence of equilibrium properties.},

  abstract    = {G-protein-coupled receptors are eukaryotic membrane proteins with broad biological and pharmacological relevance. Like all membrane-embedded proteins, their location and orientation are influenced by lipids, which can also impact protein function via specific interactions. Extensive simulations totaling 0.25Â ms reveal a process in which phospholipids from the membrane's cytosolic leaflet enter the empty G-protein binding site of an activated Î²2 adrenergic receptor and form salt-bridge interactions that inhibit ionic lock formation and prolong active-state residency. Simulations of the receptor embedded in an anionic membrane show increased lipid binding, providing a molecular mechanism for the experimental observation that anionic lipids can enhance receptor activity. Conservation of the arginine component of the ionic lock among Rhodopsin-like G-protein-coupled receptors suggests that intracellular lipid ingression between receptor helices H6 and H7 may be a general mechanism for active-state stabilization.},

  Abstract                 = {Birch pollinosis is one of the prevailing allergic diseases. In all, 5-20\% of birch pollinotics mount IgE antibodies against the minor birch pollen allergen Bet v 4, a Ca2+-binding polcalcin. Due to IgE cross-reactivity among the polcalcins these patients are polysensitized to various plant pollens. Determination of the high-resolution structure of holo Bet v 4 by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy reveals a canonical two EF-hand assembly in the open conformation with interhelical angles closely resembling holo calmodulin. The polcalcin-specific amphipathic COOH-terminal alpha-helix covers only a part of the hydrophobic groove on the molecular surface. Unlike the polcalcin Phl p 7 from timothy grass, which was recently shown to form a domain-swapped dimer, the hydrodynamic parameters from NMR relaxation, NMR translational diffusion, and analytical ultracentrifugation indicate that both apo and holo Bet v 4 are predominantly monomeric, raising the question of the physiological and immunological significance of the dimeric form of these polcalcins, whose physiological function is still unknown. The reduced helicity and heat stability in the CD spectra, the poor chemical shift dispersion of the NMR spectra, and the slightly increased hydrodynamic radius of apo Bet v 4 indicate a reversible structural transition upon Ca2+ binding, which explains the reduced IgE binding capacity of apo Bet v 4. The remarkable structural similarity of holo Bet v 4 and holo Phl p 7 in spite of different oligomerization states explains the IgE cross-reactivity and indicates that canonical monomers and domain-swapped dimers may be of similar allergenicity. Together with the close structural homology to calmodulin and the hydrophobic ligand binding groove this transition suggests a regulatory function for Bet v 4.},

The approach deliberately sacrificed a detailed description of any particular 3D structure of the loops in GPCRs in favor of a less precise description of many possible structures. Despite this, the approach found ensembles of the low-energy conformers of the EC loops that contained structures close to the available X-ray snapshots. For the smaller EC1 and EC3 loops (6-11 residues), our results were comparable with the best recent results obtained by other authors using much more sophisticated techniques. For the larger EC2 loops (25-34 residues), our results consistently yielded structures significantly closer to the X-ray snapshots than the results of the other authors for loops of similar size. The results suggested possible large-scale movements of the EC loops in GPCRs that might determine their conformational dynamics. The approach was also validated by accurately reproducing the docking poses for low-molecular-weight ligands in beta2AR, beta1AR, and A2AR, demonstrating the possible influence of the conformations of the EC loops on the binding sites of ligands. The approach correctly predicted the system of disulfide bridges between the EC loops in A2AR and elucidated the probable pathways for forming this system.

  abstract =             {The {beta}1- and {beta}2-adrenergic receptors ({beta}ARs) on the surface of cardiomyocytes mediate distinct effects on cardiac function and the development of heart failure by regulating production of the second messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The spatial localization in cardiomyocytes of these {beta}ARs, which are coupled to heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins), and the functional implications of their localization have been unclear. We combined nanoscale live-cell scanning ion conductance and fluorescence resonance energy transfer microscopy techniques and found that, in cardiomyocytes from healthy adult rats and mice, spatially confined {beta}2AR-induced cAMP signals are localized exclusively to the deep transverse tubules, whereas functional {beta}1ARs are distributed across the entire cell surface. In cardiomyocytes derived from a rat model of chronic heart failure, {beta}2ARs were redistributed from the transverse tubules to the cell crest, which led to diffuse receptor-mediated cAMP signaling. Thus, the redistribution of {beta}2ARs in heart failure changes compartmentation of cAMP and might contribute to the failing myocardial phenotype. 10.1126/science.1185988},

  Abstract                 = {The recently discovered impact of oligomerization on G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) function further complicates the already challenging goal of unraveling the molecular and dynamic mechanisms of these receptors. To help understand the effect of oligomerization on the dynamics of GPCRs, we have compared the motion of monomeric, dimeric, and tetrameric arrangements of the prototypic GPCR rhodopsin, using an approximate-yet powerful-normal mode analysis (NMA) technique termed elastic network model (ENM). Moreover, we have used ENM to discriminate between putative dynamic mechanisms likely to account for the recently observed conformational rearrangement of the TM4,5-TM4,5 dimerization interface of GPCRs that occurs upon activation. Our results indicate: (1) significant perturbation of the normal modes (NMs) of the rhodopsin monomer upon oligomerization, which is mainly manifested at interfacial regions; (2) increased positive correlation among the transmembrane domains (TMs) and between the extracellular loop (EL) and TM regions of the rhodopsin protomer; (3) highest interresidue positive correlation at the interfaces between protomers; and (4) experimentally testable hypotheses of differential motional changes within different putative oligomeric arrangements.},

  Abstract                 = {Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy, we investigate how heterotrimeric G proteins interact with G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). In the absence of receptor activation, the alpha2A adrenergic and muscarinic M4 receptors are present on the cell membrane as dimers. Furthermore, there is an interaction between the G protein subunits alpha o, beta1, and gamma2 and a number of GPCRs including M4, alpha2A, the adenosine A1 receptor, and the dopamine D2 receptor under resting conditions. The interaction between GPCRs and Galpha proteins shows specificity: there is interaction between the alpha2A receptor and Go, but little interaction between the alpha2A receptor and Gs. In contrast, the predominantly Gs-coupled prostacyclin receptor interacted with Gs, but there was little interaction between the prostacyclin receptor and Go. Inverse agonists did not change the FRET ratio, whereas the addition of agonist resulted in a modest fall. Our work suggests that GPCR dimers and the G protein heterotrimer are present at the cell membrane in the resting state in a pentameric complex.},

Originally developed in the context of protein folding, structure-based models (SBMs) have since been extended to probe a diverse range of biomolecular processes, spanning from protein and RNA folding to functional transitions in molecular machines. The hallmark feature of a structure-based model is that part, or all, of the potential energy function is defined by a known structure. Within this general class of models, there exist many possible variations in resolution and energetic composition. SMOG 2 is a downloadable software package that reads user-designated structural information and user-defined energy definitions, in order to produce the files necessary to use SBMs with high performance molecular dynamics packages: GROMACS and NAMD. SMOG 2 is bundled with XML-formatted template files that define commonly used SBMs, and it can process template files that are altered according to the needs of each user. This computational infrastructure also allows for experimental or bioinformatics-derived restraints or novel structural features to be included, e.g. novel ligands, prosthetic groups and post-translational/transcriptional modifications.

We recently introduced an all-atom SBM that explicitly represents the atomic geometry of a biomolecule. While this initial study showed the robustness of the all-atom SBM Hamiltonian to changes in many of the energetic parameters, an important aspect, which has not been explored previously, is the definition of native interactions. In this study, we propose a general definition for generating atomically grained contact maps called "Shadow". The Shadow algorithm initially considers all atoms within a cutoff distance and then, controlled by a screening parameter, discards the occluded contacts. We show that this choice of contact map is not only well behaved for protein folding, since it produces consistently cooperative folding behavior in SBMs but also desirable for exploring the dynamics of macromolecular assemblies since, it distributes energy similarly between RNAs and proteins despite their disparate internal packing. All-atom structure-based models employing Shadow contact maps provide a general framework for exploring the geometrical features of biomolecules, especially the connections between folding and function.},

  Abstract                 = {G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) can modulate diverse signaling pathways, often in a ligand-specific manner. The full range of functionally relevant GPCR conformations is poorly understood. Here, we use NMR spectroscopy to characterize the conformational dynamics of the transmembrane core of the Î²(2)-adrenergic receptor (Î²(2)AR), a prototypical GPCR. We labeled Î²(2)AR with (13)CH(3)Îµ-methionine and obtained HSQC spectra of unliganded receptor as well as receptor bound to an inverse agonist, an agonist, and a G-protein-mimetic nanobody. These studies provide evidence for conformational states not observed in crystal structures, as well as substantial conformational heterogeneity in agonist- and inverse-agonist-bound preparations. They also show that for Î²(2)AR, unlike rhodopsin, an agonist alone does not stabilize a fully active conformation, suggesting that the conformational link between the agonist-binding pocket and the G-protein-coupling surface is not rigid. The observed heterogeneity may be important for Î²(2)AR's ability to engage multiple signaling and regulatory proteins.},

Despite its widespread use, questions remain about its efficiency compared with conventional, constant temperature molecular dynamics (MD). An analytic approach is taken to describe the relative efficiency of REMD with respect to MD. This is applied to several simple two-state models and to several real proteinsprotein L and the B domain of protein Ato predict the relative efficiency of REMD with respect to MD in actual applications. In agreement with others, we find the following: as long as there is a positive activation energy for folding, REMD is more efficient than MD; the effectiveness of REMD is strongly dependent on the activation enthalpy; and the efficiency of REMD for actual proteins is a strong function of the maximum temperature. Choosing the maximum temperature too high can result in REMD becoming significantly less efficient than conventional MD. A good rule of thumb appears to be to choose the maximum temperature of the REMD simulation slightly above the temperature at which the enthalpy for folding vanishes. Additionally, we find that the number of replicas in REMD, while important for simulations shorter than one or two relaxation times, has a minimal effect on the asymptotic efficiency of the method.},

  Abstract                 = {We implement the replica exchange molecular dynamics algorithm to study the interactions of a model peptide (WALP-16) with an explicitly represented DPPC membrane bilayer. We observe the spontaneous, unbiased insertion of WALP-16 into the DPPC bilayer and its folding into an alpha-helix with a transbilayer orientation. The free energy surface suggests that the insertion of the peptide into the DPPC bilayer precedes secondary structure formation. Although the peptide has some propensity to form a partially helical structure in the interfacial region of the DPPC/water system, this state is not a productive intermediate but rather an off-pathway trap for WALP-16 insertion. Equilibrium simulations show that the observed insertion/folding pathway mirrors the potential of mean force (PMF). Calculation of the enthalpic and entropic contributions to this PMF show that the surface bound conformation of WALP-16 is significantly lower in energy than other conformations, and that the insertion of WALP-16 into the bilayer without regular secondary structure is enthalpically unfavorable by 5-10 kcal/mol/residue. The observed insertion/folding pathway disagrees with the dominant conceptual model, which is that a surface-bound helix is an obligatory intermediate for the insertion of alpha-helical peptides into lipid bilayers. In our simulations, the observed insertion/folding pathway is favored because of a large (>100 kcal/mol) increase in system entropy that occurs when the unstructured WALP-16 peptide enters the lipid bilayer interior. The insertion/folding pathway that is lowest in free energy depends sensitively on the near cancellation of large enthalpic and entropic terms. This suggests the possibility that intrinsic membrane peptides may have a diversity of insertion/folding behaviors depending on the exact system of peptide and lipid under consideration.},

  Abstract                 = {Exposure of two adjacent thymines in DNA to UV light of 260-320 nm can result in the formation of the cis,syn-cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD). The structure of DNA containing an intrahelical CPD lesion has been previously studied experimentally and computationally. However, the structure of the extrahelical, flipped-out, CPD lesion, which has been shown to be the structure that binds to the CPD repair enzyme, DNA photolyase, has yet to be reported. In this work the structure of both the flipped-in and the flipped-out CPD lesions in duplex DNA is reported. These structures were calculated using 8 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These structures are then used to define the starting and ending points for the base-flipping process for the CPD lesion. Using a complex, two-dimensional pseudodihedral coordinate, the potential of mean force (PMF) for the base-flipping process was calculcated using novel methodology. The free energy of the flipped-out CPD is roughly 6.5 kcal/mol higher than that of the flipped-in state, indicating that the barrier to flipping out is much lower for CPD than for undamaged DNA. This may indicate that the flipped-out CPD lesion may be recognized by its repair enzyme, DNA photolyase, whereas previous studies of other damaged, as well as nondamaged, bases indicate that they are recognized by enzymes in the intrahelical, flipped-in state.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Leukotrienes (LTs) are important in asthma, and LT modifiers modulate antigen-induced asthma. Overproduction of LT by suppression of cyclooxygenase activity is involved in patients with aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA). METHODS: House dust mite (HDM) inhalation provocation tests were performed in HDM-sensitive asthmatic inpatients without AIA (HDM group; n = 6), and aspirin oral provocation tests were performed in AIA patients (ASA group; n = 7). Tests were repeated using the same regimen after 7 days of treatment with pranlukast, an LT receptor antagonist (LTRA). The effects of pranlukast on changes in sputum LTC(4)-LTD(4), eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil count, urinary LTE(4)/creatinine, 11-dehydrothromboxane B(2) (11-dhTXB(2))/creatinine, serum LTC(4)-LTD(4), ECP, and peripheral blood eosinophil count, during immediate asthmatic reaction (IAR) and late asthmatic reaction (LAR) in the HDM group and during IAR in the ASA group for each test, were compared in each group. RESULTS: In the HDM group, IAR and LAR were observed. Sputum LTC(4)-LTD(4) and urinary LTE(4)/creatinine increased significantly both during IAR and LAR. Sputum ECP increased during IAR and further increased during LAR. Eosinophil count in the sputum did not increase during IAR but significantly increased during LAR. Pranlukast suppressed the fall in FEV(1) both during IAR and LAR (73.8\% and 51.9\%, respectively) and inhibited the increase in sputum eosinophil count during LAR and sputum ECP during IAR and LAR. In the ASA group, aspirin-induced IAR was associated with a fall in urinary 11-dhTXB(2)/creatinine, increased the levels of sputum LTC(4)-LTD(4) and ECP and urinary LTE(4)/creatinine. Pranlukast suppressed IAR and inhibited the increase of the level of sputum ECP, but failed to change aspirin-induced LT production in the sputum and urine. The levels of sputum LTC(4)-LTD(4) and urinary LTE(4)/creatinine in the stable phase in the ASA group were significantly greater than those in the HDM group. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that HDM-provoked asthma is associated with overproduction of LT with an antigen-antibody reaction, while AIA is associated with overproduction of LT with a shift to the 5-lipoxygenase series of the arachidonate cascade. LTRA may be useful against both types of asthma through inhibition of LT activity and eosinophilic inflammation of the airways.},

The DNA-binding domain of DnaA, domain IV, comprises the C-terminal 94 amino acid residues of the protein. We overproduced and purified a protein containing only this domain plus a methionine residue. This protein was stable as a monomer and maintained DnaA box-specific binding activity. We then analyzed its solution structure by CD spectrum and heteronuclear multi-dimensional NMR experiments. We established extensive assignments of the 1H, 13C, and 15N nuclei, and revealed by obtaining combined analyses of chemical shift index and NOE connectivities that DnaA domain IV contains six alpha-helices and no beta-sheets, consistent with results of CD analysis. Mutations known to reduce DnaA box-binding activity were specifically located in or near two of the alpha-helices. These findings indicate that the DNA-binding fold of DnaA domain IV is unique among origin-binding proteins.},

The present study elucidates the thermodynamic origin of POE complexation selectivity between alkali cations or between terminal groups in the ligand, and permits speculation of stable structures of the ligand. POE, having a long lipophilic terminal group, tends to adopt the extended form both in solution and in the resin phase, whereas that having a small terminal group favours more compact forms. From evaluations of the contributions of each process to the overall DELTA-H, the selectivity between terminal groups in the ligand is found to emerge from the DELTA-H required for the conformational change of the ligand. In contrast, selectivity of POE complex formation between alkali cations is explained by a difference in DELTA-S, principally by that released by the desolvation of the metal cation.},

  Abstract                 = {Activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is triggered and regulated by structural rearrangement of the transmembrane heptahelical bundle containing a number of highly conserved residues. In rhodopsin, a prototypical GPCR, the helical bundle accommodates an intrinsic inverse-agonist 11-cis-retinal, which undergoes photo-isomerization to the all-trans form upon light absorption. Such a trigger by the chromophore corresponds to binding of a diffusible ligand to other GPCRs. Here we have explored the functional role of water molecules in the transmembrane region of bovine rhodopsin by using x-ray diffraction to 2.6 A. The structural model suggests that water molecules, which were observed in the vicinity of highly conserved residues and in the retinal pocket, regulate the activity of rhodopsin-like GPCRs and spectral tuning in visual pigments, respectively. To confirm the physiological relevance of the structural findings, we conducted single-crystal microspectrophotometry on rhodopsin packed in our three-dimensional crystals and show that its spectroscopic properties are similar to those previously found by using bovine rhodopsin in suspension or membrane environment.},

  Abstract                 = {A new high-resolution structure is reported for bovine rhodopsin, the visual pigment in rod photoreceptor cells. Substantial improvement of the resolution limit to 2.2 A has been achieved by new crystallization conditions, which also reduce significantly the probability of merohedral twinning in the crystals. The new structure completely resolves the polypeptide chain and provides further details of the chromophore binding site including the configuration about the C6-C7 single bond of the 11-cis-retinal Schiff base. Based on both an earlier structure and the new improved model of the protein, a theoretical study of the chromophore geometry has been carried out using combined quantum mechanics/force field molecular dynamics. The consistency between the experimental and calculated chromophore structures is found to be significantly improved for the 2.2 A model, including the angle of the negatively twisted 6-s-cis-bond. Importantly, the new crystal structure refinement reveals significant negative pre-twist of the C11-C12 double bond and this is also supported by the theoretical calculation although the latter converges to a smaller value. Bond alternation along the unsaturated chain is significant, but weaker in the calculated structure than the one obtained from the X-ray data. Other differences between the experimental and theoretical structures in the chromophore binding site are discussed with respect to the unique spectral properties and excited state reactivity of the chromophore.},

  annotation = {The complex formation of crown ethers with ammonium ions chemically bonded on silica gel has been chromatographically investigated. Although the selectivity in the complex formation of crown ethers is basically the same as in solution, a counter anion existing in the diffuse double layer of the silica gel also plays an important role, even when a polar solvent with hydrogen-bond formation ability such as methanol, is used as a medium. The overall complex formation at the silica gel surface can be divided into three processes: (i) the dissociation of a counter anion from its ion-pair with the ammonium ion; (ii) complex formation of a crown ether with the ammonium ion; (iii) formation of an ion-pair between the anion and the ammonium ion complexed by the crown ether. This mechanism is evaluated from thermodynamic viewpoints including the solvation of anions, the ion-pair formation of anions with ammonium, etc.},

  Abstract                 = {We elucidate the physics of protein dynamical transition via 10-100-ns molecular dynamics simulations at temperatures spanning 160-300 K. By tracking the energy fluctuations, we show that the protein dynamical transition is marked by a crossover from nonstationary to stationary processes that underlie the dynamics of protein motions. A two-timescale function captures the nonexponential character of backbone structural relaxations. One timescale is attributed to the collective segmental motions and the other to local relaxations. The former is well defined by a single-exponential, nanosecond decay, operative at all temperatures. The latter is described by a set of processes that display a distribution of timescales. Although their average remains on the picosecond timescale, the distribution is markedly contracted at the onset of the transition. It is shown that the collective motions impose bounds on timescales spanned by local dynamical processes. The nonstationary character below the transition implicates the presence of a collection of substates whose interactions are restricted. At these temperatures, a wide distribution of local-motion timescales, extending beyond that of nanoseconds, is observed. At physiological temperatures, local motions are confined to timescales faster than nanoseconds. This relatively narrow window makes possible the appearance of multiple channels for the backbone dynamics to operate.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a detailed analysis of the behavior of the highly flexible post-translational lipid modifications of rhodopsin from multiple-microsecond all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Rhodopsin was studied in a realistic membrane environment that includes cholesterol, as well as saturated and polyunsaturated lipids with phosphocholine and phosphoethanolamine headgroups. The simulation reveals striking differences between the palmitoylations at Cys322 and Cys323 as well as between the palmitoyl chains and the neighboring lipids. Notably the palmitoyl group at Cys322 shows considerably greater contact with helix H1 of rhodopsin, yielding frequent chain upturns with longer reorientational correlation times, and relatively low order parameters. While the palmitoylation at Cys323 makes fewer protein contacts and has increased order compared to Cys322, it nevertheless exhibits greater flexibility with smaller order parameters than the stearoyl chains of the surrounding lipids. The dynamical structure of the palmitoylations-as well as their extensive fluctuations-suggests a complex function for the post-translational modifications in rhodopsin and potentially other G protein-coupled receptors, going beyond their role as membrane anchoring elements. Rather, we propose that the palmitoylation at Cys323 has a potential role as a lipid anchor, whereas the palmitoyl-protein interaction observed for Cys322 suggests a more specific interaction that affects the stability of the dark state of rhodopsin.},

  Abstract                 = {This article presents a comparative analysis of two replica-exchange simulation methods for the structure refinement of protein loop conformations, starting from low-resolution predictions. The methods are self-guided Langevin dynamics (SGLD) and molecular dynamics (MD) with a NosÃ©-Hoover thermostat. We investigated a small dataset of 8- and 12-residue loops, with the shorter loops placed initially from a coarse-grained lattice model and the longer loops from an enumeration assembly method (the Loopy program). The CHARMM22 + CMAP force field with a generalized Born implicit solvent model (molecular-surface parameterized GBSW2) was used to explore conformational space. We also assessed two empirical scoring methods to detect nativelike conformations from decoys: the all-atom distance-scaled ideal-gas reference state (DFIRE-AA) statistical potential and the Rosetta energy function. Among the eight-residue loop targets, SGLD out performed MD in all cases, with a median of 0.48 Ã reduction in global root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the loop backbone coordinates from the native structure. Among the more challenging 12-residue loop targets, SGLD improved the prediction accuracy over MD by a median of 1.31 Ã, representing a substantial improvement. The overall median RMSD for SGLD simulations of 12-residue loops was 0.91 Ã, yielding refinement of a median 2.70 Ã from initial loop placement. Results from DFIRE-AA and the Rosetta model applied to rescoring conformations failed to improve the overall detection calculated from the CHARMM force field. We illustrate the advantage of SGLD over the MD simulation model by presenting potential-energy landscapes for several loop predictions. Our results demonstrate that SGLD significantly outperforms traditional MD in the generation and populating of nativelike loop conformations and that the CHARMM force field performs comparably to other empirical force fields in identifying these conformations from the resulting ensembles.},

  Abstract                 = {Results presented in this paper describe the ability of Bacillus subtilis strain M4 to reduce disease incidence caused by Colletotrichum lagenarium and Pythium aphanidermatum on cucumber and tomato, respectively. Disease protection in both pathosystems was most probably due to induction of resistance in the host plant since experiments were designed in order to avoid any direct contact between the biocontrol agent and the pathogen. Pre-inoculation with strain M4 thus sensitised both plants to react more efficiently to subsequent pathogen infection. In cucumber, the use of endospores provided a disease control level similar to that obtained with vegetative cells. In contrast, a mixture of lipopeptides from the surfactin, iturin and fengycin families showed no resistance-inducing potential. Interestingly, treatment with strain M4 was also associated with significant changes in gene transcription in the host plant as revealed by cDNA-AFLP analyses. Several AFLP fragments corresponded to genes not expressed in control plants and specifically induced by the Bacillus treatment. In support to the macroscopic protective effect, this differential accumulation of mRNA also illustrates the plant reaction following perception of strain M4, and constitutes one of the very first examples of defence-associated modifications at the transcriptional level elicited by a non-pathogenic bacterium in a host plant.},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, the potential of Bacillus subtilis strain M4 at protecting plants against fungal diseases was demonstrated in different pathosystems. We provide evidence for the role of secreted lipopeptides, and more particularly of fengycins, in the protective effect afforded by the strain against damping-off of bean seedlings caused by Pythium ultimum and against gray mold of apple in post-harvest disease. This role was demonstrated by the strong biocontrol activity of lipopeptide-enriched extracts and through the detection of inhibitory quantities of fengycins in infected tissues. Beside such a direct antagonism of the pathogen, we show that root pre-inoculation with M4 enabled the host plant to react more efficiently to subsequent pathogen infection on leaves. Fengycins could also be involved in this systemic resistance-eliciting effect of strain M4, as these molecules may induce the synthesis of plant phenolics involved in or derived from the defense-related phenylpropanoid metabolism. Much remains to be discovered about the mechanisms by which Bacillus spp suppress disease. Through this study on strain M4, we reinforce the interest in B. subtilis as a pathogen antagonist and plant defense-inducing agent. The secretion of cyclic fengycin-type lipopeptides may be tightly related to the expression of these two biocontrol traits.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiple strains of Bacillus spp. were demonstrated to stimulate plant defence responses. However, very little is known about the nature of molecular determinants secreted by these Gram-positive bacteria that are responsible for the elicitation of the induced systemic resistance (ISR) phenomenon. This study shows that the lipopeptides surfactins and fengycins may be involved in this elicitation process. In bean, pure fengycins and surfactins provided a significant ISR-mediated protective effect on bean plants, similar to the one induced by living cells of the producing strain S499. Moreover, experiments conducted on bean and tomato plants showed that overexpression of both surfactin and fengycin biosynthetic genes in the naturally poor producer Bacillus subtilis strain 168 was associated with a significant increase in the potential of the derivatives to induce resistance. In tomato cells, key enzymes of the lipoxygenase pathway appeared to be activated in resistant plants following induction by lipopeptide overproducers. To our knowledge, such lipopeptides constitute a novel class of compounds from non-pathogenic bacteria that can be perceived by plant cells as signals to initiate defence mechanisms.},

  abstract =             {PMID: 20047303 Essential to cells and their organelles, water is both shuttled to where it is needed and trapped within cellular compartments and structures. Moreover, ordered waters within protein structures often colocalize with strategically placed polar or charged groups critical for protein function, yet it is unclear if these ordered water molecules provide structural stabilization, mediate conformational changes in signaling, neutralize charged residues, or carry out a combination of all these functions. Structures of many integral membrane proteins, including G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), reveal the presence of ordered water molecules that may act like prosthetic groups in a manner quite unlike bulk water. Identification of Ã¢ÂÂ orderedÃ¢ÂÂ waters within a crystalline protein structure requires sufficient occupancy of water to enable its detection in the protein's X-ray diffraction pattern, and thus, the observed waters likely represent a subset of tightly bound functional waters. In this review, we highlight recent studies that suggest the structures of ordered waters within GPCRs are as conserved (and thus as important) as conserved side chains. In addition, methods of radiolysis, coupled to structural mass spectrometry (protein footprinting), reveal dynamic changes in water structure that mediate transmembrane signaling. The idea of water as a prosthetic group mediating chemical reaction dynamics is not new in fields such as catalysis. However, the concept of water as a mediator of conformational dynamics in signaling is just emerging, because of advances in both crystallographic structure determination and new methods of protein footprinting. Although oil and water do not mix, understanding the roles of water is essential to understanding the function of membrane proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {Several bioactive peptides exert their biological function by interacting with cellular membranes. Structural data on their location inside lipid bilayers are thus essential for a detailed understanding of their mechanism of action. We propose here a combined approach in which fluorescence spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were applied to investigate the mechanism of membrane perturbation by the antimicrobial peptide PMAP-23. Fluorescence spectra, depth-dependent quenching experiments, and peptide-translocation assays were employed to determine the location of the peptide inside the membrane. MD simulations were performed starting from a random mixture of water, lipids and peptide, and following the spontaneous self-assembly of the bilayer. Both experimental and theoretical data indicated a peptide location just below the polar headgroups of the membrane, with an orientation essentially parallel to the bilayer plane. These findings, together with experimental results on peptide-induced leakage from large and giant vesicles, lipid flip-flop and peptide exchange between vesicles, support a mechanism of action consistent with the "carpet" model. Furthermore, the atomic detail provided by the simulations suggested the occurrence of an additional, more specific and novel mechanism of bilayer destabilization by PMAP-23, involving the unusual insertion of charged side chains into the hydrophobic core of the membrane.},

  Abstract                 = {A new coarse-grain model for molecular dynamics simulation of lipid membranes is presented. Following a simple and conventional approach, lipid molecules are modeled by spherical sites, each representing a group of several atoms. In contrast to common coarse-grain methods, two original (interdependent) features are here adopted. First, the main electrostatics are modeled explicitly by charges and dipoles, which interact realistically through a relative dielectric constant of unity (Îµ(r) = 1). Second, water molecules are represented individually through a new parametrization of the simple Stockmayer potential for polar fluids; each water molecule is therefore described by a single spherical site embedded with a point dipole. The force field is shown to accurately reproduce the main physical properties of single-species phospholipid bilayers comprising dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) in the liquid crystal phase, as well as distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) in the liquid crystal and gel phases. Insights are presented into fundamental properties and phenomena that can be difficult or impossible to study with alternative computational or experimental methods. For example, we investigate the internal pressure distribution, dipole potential, lipid diffusion, and spontaneous self-assembly. Simulations lasting up to 1.5 microseconds were conducted for systems of different sizes (128, 512 and 1058 lipids); this also allowed us to identify size-dependent artifacts that are expected to affect membrane simulations in general. Future extensions and applications are discussed, particularly in relation to the methodology's inherent multiscale capabilities.},

Second, water is accurately (yet efficiently) described, on an individual level, by the soft sticky dipole model. Third, hydrocarbon tails are modeled using the anisotropic Gay-Berne potential. Simulations are conducted by rigid-body molecular dynamics. Our technique proves 2 orders of magnitude less demanding of computational resources than traditional atomic-level methodology. Self-assembled bilayers quantitatively reproduce experimental observables such as electron density, compressibility moduli, dipole potential, lipid diffusion, and water permeability. The lateral pressure profile has been calculated, along with the elastic curvature constants of the Helfrich expression for the membrane bending energy; results are consistent with experimental estimates and atomic-level simulation data. Several of the results presented have been obtained for the first time using a coarse-grain method. Our model is also directly compatible with atomic-level force fields, allowing mixed systems to be simulated in a multiscale fashion.},

In fact, a complete representation of the system electrostatics and a realistic description of the water component make our method unique amongst the existing coarse-grain membrane models. The spontaneous permeation of water, a phenomenon out of reach of standard atomistic models, was also observed and quantified; this was possible thanks to the efficiency of our model, which is about two orders of magnitude less computationally expensive than atomic-level counterparts.

In this computational study, we present molecular-level insights into the interaction between these antimicrobial agents and hydrated phospholipid bilayers (taken as a simple model for the cell membrane). Simulations are conducted by a novel 'dual-resolution' molecular dynamics approach which combines accuracy with efficiency: the antimicrobials, modelled atomistically, are mixed with simplified (coarse-grain) models of lipids and water. A first set of calculations is run to study the antimicrobials' transfer free energies and orientations as a function of depth inside the membrane. Both molecules are predicted to preferentially accumulate in the lipid headgroup-glycerol region; this finding, which reproduces corresponding experimental data, is also discussed in terms of a general relation between solute partitioning and the intramembrane distribution of pressure. A second set of runs involves membranes incorporated with different molar concentrations of antimicrobial molecules (up to one antimicrobial per two lipids). We study the effects induced on fundamental membrane properties, such as the electron density, lateral pressure and electrical potential profiles. In particular, the analysis of the spontaneous curvature indicates that increasing antimicrobial concentrations promote a 'destabilizing' tendency towards non-bilayer phases, as observed experimentally. The antimicrobials' influence on the self-assembly process is also investigated. The significance of our results in the context of current theories of antimicrobial action is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The transmembrane permeation of eight small (molecular weight <100) organic molecules across a phospholipid bilayer is investigated by multiscale molecular dynamics simulation. The bilayer and hydrating water are represented by simplified, efficient coarse-grain models, whereas the permeating molecules are described by a standard atomic-level force-field. Permeability properties are obtained through a refined version of the z-constraint algorithm. By constraining each permeant at selected depths inside the bilayer, we have sampled free energy differences and diffusion coefficients across the membrane. These data have been combined, according to the inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model, to yield the permeability coefficients. The results are generally consistent with previous atomic-level calculations and available experimental data. Computationally, our multiscale approach proves 2 orders of magnitude faster than traditional atomic-level methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Indolicidin is a 13-residue cationic, antimicrobial peptide-amide isolated from the cytoplasmic granules of bovine neutrophils. The unique composition of indolicidin distinguishes it from alpha-helical and beta-structured cationic peptides, because five of indolicidin's 13 residues are tryptophans: H-Ile-Leu-Pro-Trp-Lys-Trp-Pro-Trp-Trp-Pro-Trp-Arg-Arg-NH(2). Solid phase synthesis of indolicidin gave rise to a minor byproduct that possessed unusual fluorescence and UV absorbance properties compared with authentic indolicidin. The byproduct was purified by combined ion exchange and reversed phase high pressure liquid chromatography steps and was shown be identical to authentic indolicidin in its microbicidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Mass analysis of the byproduct revealed a 2-atomic mass unit reduction compared with indolicidin, suggesting the deprotonation of two indole side chains to form an intrachain delta(1),delta(1)'-ditryptophan derivative. We confirmed the nature of the cross-linked byproduct, termed X-indolicidin, by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy, peptide mapping, and sequence analysis. Edman degradation revealed that Trp-6 and Trp-9 were covalently cross-linked. Compared with indolicidin, X-indolicidin was partially resistant to digestion with trypsin and chymotrypsin, suggesting that the ditryptophan stabilizes a subset of molecular conformations that are protease resistant but that are absent in the native structure.},

Two cases are examined: the protein influences the lipid order (i.e., "fluidity"), and the protein associates with one component of a lipid mixture preferentially. The order perturbation is studied as a function of temperature and lateral pressure by using Landau--de Gennes theory and a variational procedure. It is concluded that, for a given lateral pressure, the greatest amount of boundary lipid is present at the lipid phase-transition temperature. A critical point for the phase transition occurs, near which the amount of boundary lipid increases dramatically. The composition perturbation is modeled in a binary lipid mixture by using a simple regular solution theory. The perturbation is found not to extent much beyond the directly bound layer of lipids unless the solution is near a critical mixing point.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiologic studies indicate that antibiotic use in infancy may be associated with an increased risk of development of atopy; however, its precise mechanism remains to be elucidated. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to clarify whether one such antibiotic, kanamycin, affects the T(H)1/T(H)2 balance. METHODS: BALB/c mice at 3 and 52 weeks of age were orally administered 600 mg/d kanamycin sulfate for 7 consecutive days. Blood samples were collected on weeks 0, 10, 18, and 26 after the cessation of kanamycin treatment, and the effect of the kanamycin treatment on the T(H)1/T(H)2 balance was evaluated on the basis of both the in vivo antibody levels and the in vitro splenocyte cytokine secretion pattern. RESULTS: The administration of kanamycin increased the serum levels of total IgG1 and IgE while decreasing the serum IgG2a levels. Moreover, when spleen cells were stimulated with immobilized anti-CD3 antibody in vitro, such kanamycin treatment enhanced the in vitro IL-4 secretion while reducing the in vitro IFN-gamma secretion. The basal IL-12 p70 secretion levels of splenic dendritic cells in the kanamycin-treated mice were lower than those in the control mice, although no significant difference was seen in IL-12 p40 levels between either group of mice. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that antibiotic use during infancy may indeed quantitatively disturb, qualitatively disturb, or both the intestinal microflora and thereby prevent postnatal T(H)1 cell maturation, thus resulting in a T(H)2-polarized immune deviation.},

In the gel phase, PGLa induces a quasi-interdigitated phase, previously reported also for other peptides, which is most pronounced for C18 phosphatidylglycerol. In the fluid phase we found an increase of the membrane thickness and NMR order parameter for C14 and C16 phosphatidylglycerol bilayers, though not for C18. The data is best understood in terms of a close hydrophobic match between the C18 bilayer core and the peptide length when PGLa is inserted with its helical axis normal to the bilayer surface. The C16 acyl chains appear to stretch in order to accommodate PGLa, whereas tilting within the bilayer seems to be energetically favorable for the peptide when inserted into bilayers of C14 phosphatidylglycerol. In contrast to the commonly accepted membrane thinning effect of antimicrobial peptides, the data demonstrate that pore formation does not necessarily relate to changes in the overall bilayer structure. 10.1529/biophysj.108.141630},

The major structural motifs observed for rhodopsin are expected to carry over to other GPCRs, and the mechanism of transformation of the receptor from inactive to active forms is thus likely conserved. Moreover, the high expression level of rhodopsin in the retina, its specific localization in the internal disks of the photoreceptor structures [termed rod outer segments (ROS)], and the lack of other highly abundant membrane proteins allow rhodopsin to be examined in the native disk membranes by a number of methods. The results of these investigations provide evidence of the propensity of rhodopsin and, most likely, other GPCRs to dimerize, a property that may be pertinent to their function.},

  abstract    = {Explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the triple helix of the polysaccharide Scleroglucan (Sclg) at two temperatures (273 and 300 K) were carried out. Owing to the complexity of the system, a united-atom force field, based on the properly modified GROMACS parameters, was adopted. To test these parameters for our system, MD simulations of the two disaccharidic units, representing the main chain and the side-chain linkages of the Sclg repeating unit, were performed and the results were compared with the literature data. The simulated triple helix of Sclg retained the main experimentally determined features of the polymer. The residence times of the solvent molecules at 273 and 300 K were analyzed. The results show that the more internal water molecules, interacting with the core of the Sclg triplex are not influenced substantially by changing the temperature, on the contrary the water molecules, interacting with the side-chain glucose residues show more significant differences. These data suggest that the more external water molecules, interacting with the side chain, play a major role in the conformational transition experimentally observed at low temperature.},

  abstract    = {Simulating protein folding has been a challenging problem for decades due to the long timescales involved (compared with what is possible to simulate) and the challenges of gaining insight from the complex nature of the resulting simulation data. Markov State Models (MSMs) present a means to tackle both of these challenges, yielding simulations on experimentally relevant timescales, statistical significance, and coarse grained representations that are readily humanly understandable. Here, we review this method with the intended audience of non-experts, in order to introduce the method to a broader audience. We review the motivations, methods, and caveats of MSMs, as well as some recent highlights of applications of the method. We conclude by discussing how this approach is part of a paradigm shift in how one uses simulations, away from anecdotal single-trajectory approaches to a more comprehensive statistical approach.},

  Abstract                 = {The fundamental role of cholesterol in the regulation of eukaryotic membrane structure is well-established. However the manner in which atomic level interactions between cholesterol and lipids, with varying degrees of chain unsaturation and polar groups, affect the overall structure and organization of the bilayer is only beginning to be understood. In this paper we describe a series of Molecular Dynamics simulations designed to provide new insights into lipid-cholesterol interactions as a function of chain unsaturation. We have run simulations of varying concentrations of cholesterol in dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine (DPPC), palmitoyl-oleyol phosphatidylcholine (POPC), and dioleyol phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers. Structural analysis of the simulations reveals both atomistic and systemic details of the interactions and are presented here. In particular, we find that the minimum partial molecular area of cholesterol occurs in POPC-Chol mixtures implying the most favorable packing. Physically, this appears to be related to the fact that the two faces of the cholesterol molecule are different from each other and that the steric cross section of cholesterol molecules drops sharply near the small chain tails.},

  Abstract                 = {It is known from experimental studies that lipid bilayers composed of unsaturated phospholipids, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol contain microdomains rich in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. These domains are similar to "rafts" isolated from cell membranes, although the latter are much smaller in lateral size. Such domain formation can be a result of very specific and subtle lipid-lipid interactions. To identify and study these interactions, we have performed two molecular dynamics simulations, of 200-ns duration, of dioleylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), sphingomyelin (SM), and cholesterol (Chol) systems, a 1:1:1 mixture of DOPC/SM/Chol, and a 1:1 mixture of DOPC/SM. The simulations show initial stages of the onset of spontaneous phase-separated domains in the systems. On the simulation timescale cholesterol favors a position at the interface between the ordered SM region and the disordered DOPC region in the ternary system and accelerates the process of domain formation. We find that the smooth alpha-face of Chol preferentially packs next to SM molecules. Based on a comparative analysis of interaction energies, we find that Chol molecules do not show a preference for SM or DOPC. We conclude that Chol molecules assist in the process of domain formation and the process is driven by entropic factors rather than differences in interaction energies.},

Although structural properties of lipid-cholesterol mixtures have been extensively studied, an understanding of the role of cholesterol in the lateral organization of bilayers has been elusive. In this article, we propose a simple yet powerful model, based on self-consistent mean-field theory and molecular dynamics simulations, for lipid bilayers containing cholesterol. Properties predicted by our model are shown to be in excellent agreement with experimental data. Our model predicts that cholesterol induces structural changes in the bilayer through the formation of regions of ordered lipids surrounding each cholesterol molecule. We find that the "smooth" and "rough" sides of cholesterol play crucial roles in formation and distribution of the ordered regions. Our model is predictive in that input parameters are obtained from independent atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. The model and method are general enough to describe other heterogeneous lipid bilayers, including lipid rafts.},

  Abstract                 = {Amphotericin B (AmB) is a widely used polyene antibiotic to treat systemic fungal infections. This drug is known to be lethal to fungal cells but it has also side effect toxicity on mammalian cells. The mechanism of action of AmB is thought to be related to the difference of the main sterol present in the mammalian and the fungal cells, namely cholesterol and ergosterol, respectively. The effect of AmB has been investigated on pure dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and on cholesterol- and ergosterol-containing DPPC bilayers by 2H NMR spectroscopy. The 2H NMR results first confirm that AmB forms a complex with sterol-free DPPC bilayers, the interaction causing the structurization of the lipids and the increase of the gel-to-lamellar fluid DPPC phase transition temperature with increasing concentration of the antibiotic. The results also show that the effects of AmB on cholesterol- and ergosterol-containing DPPC bilayers are remarkably different. On one hand, the drug causes an increase of the orientational order of the lipid acyl chains in cholesterol-containing membranes, mostly in high cholesterol content membranes. On the other hand, the addition of AmB disorders the DPPC acyl chains when ergosterol is present. This is thought to be due to the direct complexation of the ergosterol by AmB, causing the sterol ordering effect to be weaker on the lipids.},

  Abstract                 = {In the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) rhodopsin, the inactivating ligand 11-cis-retinal is bound in the seven-transmembrane helix (TM) bundle and is cis/trans isomerized by light to form active metarhodopsin II. With metarhodopsin II decay, all-trans-retinal is released, and opsin is reloaded with new 11-cis-retinal. Here we present the crystal structure of ligand-free native opsin from bovine retinal rod cells at 2.9 Ã¥ngstrÃ¶m (A) resolution. Compared to rhodopsin, opsin shows prominent structural changes in the conserved E(D)RY and NPxxY(x)(5,6)F regions and in TM5-TM7. At the cytoplasmic side, TM6 is tilted outwards by 6-7 A, whereas the helix structure of TM5 is more elongated and close to TM6. These structural changes, some of which were attributed to an active GPCR state, reorganize the empty retinal-binding pocket to disclose two openings that may serve the entry and exit of retinal. The opsin structure sheds new light on ligand binding to GPCRs and on GPCR activation.},

  Abstract                 = {Transformation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from a quiescent to an active state initiates signal transduction. All GPCRs share a common architecture comprising seven transmembrane-spanning alpha-helices, which accommodates signal propagation from a diverse repertoire of external stimuli across biological membranes to a heterotrimeric G protein. Signal propagation through the transmembrane helices likely involves mechanistic features common to all GPCRs. The structure of the light receptor rhodopsin may serve as a prototype for the transmembrane architecture of GPCRs. Early biochemical, biophysical, and pharmacological studies led to the conceptualization of receptor activation based on the context of two-state equilibrium models and conformational changes in protein structure. More recent studies indicate a need to move beyond these classical paradigms and to consider additional aspects of the molecular character of GPCRs, such as the oligomerization and dynamics of the receptor.},

Systematic optimization of parameters based on high level quantum mechanical data and free energy simulations have resolved these issues, and bilayers with a wide range of lipids can be simulated in tensionless ensembles using C36. Issues associated with other all-atom lipid FFs, success and limitations in the C36 FF and ongoing developments are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Due to increasing resistance development among bacteria, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), are receiving increased attention. Ideally, AMP should display high bactericidal potency, but low toxicity against (human) eukaryotic cells. Additionally, short and proteolytically stable AMPs are desired to maximize bioavailability and therapeutic versatility. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A facile approach is demonstrated for reaching high potency of ultra-short antimicrobal peptides through end-tagging with W and F stretches. Focusing on a peptide derived from kininogen, KNKGKKNGKH (KNK10) and truncations thereof, end-tagging resulted in enhanced bactericidal effect against Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. Through end-tagging, potency and salt resistance could be maintained down to 4-7 amino acids in the hydrophilic template peptide. Although tagging resulted in increased eukaryotic cell permeabilization at low ionic strength, the latter was insignificant at physiological ionic strength and in the presence of serum. Quantitatively, the most potent peptides investigated displayed bactericidal effects comparable to, or in excess of, that of the benchmark antimicrobial peptide LL-37. The higher bactericidal potency of the tagged peptides correlated to a higher degree of binding to bacteria, and resulting bacterial wall rupture. Analogously, tagging enhanced peptide-induced rupture of liposomes, particularly anionic ones. Additionally, end-tagging facilitated binding to bacterial lipopolysaccharide, both effects probably contributing to the selectivity displayed by these peptides between bacteria and eukaryotic cells. Importantly, W-tagging resulted in peptides with maintained stability against proteolytic degradation by human leukocyte elastase, as well as staphylococcal aureolysin and V8 proteinase. The biological relevance of these findings was demonstrated ex vivo for pig skin infected by S. aureus and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: End-tagging by hydrophobic amino acid stretches may be employed to enhance bactericidal potency also of ultra-short AMPs at maintained limited toxicity. The approach is of general applicability, and facilitates straightforward synthesis of hydrophobically modified AMPs without the need for post-peptide synthesis modifications.},

  abstract    = {Certain antibiotic peptides are thought to permeabilize membranes of pathogens by effects that are also observed for simple detergents, such as membrane thinning and disordering, asymmetric bilayer expansion, toroidal pore formation, and micellization. Here we test the hypothesis that such peptides act additively with detergents when applied in parallel. Additivity is defined analogously to a fractional inhibitory concentration index of unity, and the extent and mechanism of leakage is measured by the fluorescence lifetime-based vesicle leakage assay using calcein-loaded vesicles. Good additivity was found for the concerted action of magainin 2, the fungicidal lipopeptide class of surfactins from Bacillus subtilis QST713, and the detergent octyl glucoside, respectively, with the detergent C12EO8. Synergistic or superadditive action was observed for fengycins from B. subtilis, as well as the detergent CHAPS, when combined with C12EO8. The results illustrate two mechanisms of synergistic action: First, maximal leakage requires an optimum degree of heterogeneity in the system that may be achieved by mixing a graded with an all-or-none permeabilizer. (The optimal perturbation should be focused to certain defect structures, yet not to the extent that some vesicles are not affected at all.) Second, a cosurfactant may enhance the bioavailability of a poorly soluble peptide. The results are important for understanding the concerted action of membrane-permeabilizing compounds in biology as well as for optimizing formulations of such antimicrobials for medical applications or crop protection.},

  Abstract                 = {The conformational stability of a single-chain Fv antibody fragment against a hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg scFv) has been studied by urea and temperature denaturation followed by fluorescence and circular dichroism. At neutral pH and low protein concentration, it is a well-folded monomer, and its urea and thermal denaturations are reversible. The noncoincidence of the fluorescence and circular dichroism transitions indicates the accumulation in the urea denaturation of an intermediate (I(1)) not previously described in scFv molecules. In addition, at higher urea concentrations, a red-shift in the fluorescence emission maximum reveals an additional intermediate (I(2)), already reported in the denaturation of other scFvs. The urea equilibrium unfolding of the anti-HBsAg scFv is thus four-state. A similar four-state behavior is observed in the thermal unfolding although the intermediates involved are not identical to those found in the urea denaturation. Global analysis of the thermal unfolding data suggests that the first intermediate displays substantial secondary structure and some well-defined tertiary interactions while the second one lacks well-defined tertiary interactions but is compact and unfolds at higher temperature in a noncooperative fashion. Global analysis of the urea unfolding data (together with the modeled structure of the scFv) provides insights into the conformation of the chemical denaturation intermediates and allows calculation of the N-I(1), I(1)-I(2), and I(2)-D free energy differences. Interestingly, although the N-D free energy difference is very large, the N-I(1) one, representing the "relevant" conformational stability of the scFv, is small.},

  Abstract                 = {Glutamic acid E134 in rhodopsin is part of a highly conserved triad, D(E)RY, located near the cytoplasmic lipid/water interface in transmembrane helix 3 of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). A large body of experimental evidence suggests that the protonation of E134 plays a role in the mechanism of activation of rhodopsin and other GPCRs as well. For E134 to change its protonation state, its pK(a) value must shift from values below physiological pH to higher values. Because of the proximity of the triad to the lipid/water interface, it was hypothesized that a change in solvent around E134 from water to lipid could induce such a shift in pK(a). To test this hypothesis, the pK(a) values of the titratable amino acid residues in rhodopsin have been calculated and the change in solvent around E134 was modeled by shifting the position of the lipid/water interface. The approach used to carry out the pK(a) calculations takes into account the partial immersion of transmembrane proteins in lipid. Qualitative experimental evidence is available for several residues regarding their likely protonation state in rhodopsin at or near physiological pH. Comparison of the calculated pK(a) values with these experimental findings shows good agreement between the two. Notably, glutamic acids E122 and E181 were found to be protonated. The pK(a) values were then calculated for a range of lipid/water interface positions. Although the surrounding solvent of several titratable residues changed from water to lipid in this range, leading to pK(a) shifts in most cases, only for E134 would the shift lead to a change in protonation state at physiological pH. Thus, our results show that the protonation state of E134 is particularly sensitive to its environment. This sensitivity together with the location of E134 near the actual position of the lipid/water interface could be a strategic element in the mechanism of activation of rhodopsin.},

  Abstract                 = {Many integral membrane proteins assemble to form oligomeric structures in biological membranes. In particular, seven-transmembrane helical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) appear to self-assemble constitutively in membranes, but the mechanism and physiological role of this assembly are unknown. We developed and employed coarse-grain molecular dynamics (CGMD) models to investigate the molecular basis of how the physicochemical properties of the phospholipid bilayer membrane affect self-assembly of visual rhodopsin, a prototypical GPCR. The CGMD method is a mesoscopic simulation technique in which groups of atoms are mapped to particles on the basis of a four-to-one rule. This systematic reduction of the degrees of freedom allows for computationally efficient calculation of the structure and dynamics of molecular assemblies for larger time and length scales than accessible to atomistic models, providing here an unprecedented view of spontaneous protein assembly in biomembranes. Systems with up to 16 rhodopsin molecules at a protein-to-lipid ratio of 1:100 were simulated for time scales of up to 8 micros. The results obtained for four different phospholipid environments showed that localized adaptation of the membrane bilayer to the presence of receptors is reproducibly most pronounced near transmembrane helices 2, 4, and 7. This local membrane deformation appears to be a key factor defining the rate, extent, and orientational preference of protein-protein association. The implications of our findings are discussed within a framework of a generalized mechanism of membrane protein self-assembly.},

  abstract =    {The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) rhodopsin self-assembles into supramolecular structures in native bilayers, but the structural determinants of receptor oligomerization are not known. We carried out multiple self-assembly coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations of model membranes containing up to 64 molecules of the visual receptor rhodopsin over time scales reaching 100 Î¼s. The simulations show strong preferential interaction modes between receptors. Two primary modes of receptor-receptor interactions are consistent with umbrella sampling/potential of mean force (PMF) calculations as a function of the distance between a pair of receptors. The preferential interfaces, involving helices (H) 1/8, 4/5 and 5, present no energy barrier to forming a very stable receptor dimer. Most notably, the PMFs show that the preferred rhodopsin dimer exists in a tail-to-tail conformation, with the interface comprising transmembrane H1/H2 and amphipathic H8 at the extracellular and cytoplasmic surfaces, respectively. This dimer orientation is in line with earlier electron microscopy, X-ray, and cross-linking experiments of rhodopsin and other GPCRs. Less stable interfaces, involving H4 and H6, have a free energy barrier for desolvation (delipidation) of the interfaces and appear to be designed to stabilize "lubricated" (i.e., lipid-coated) dimers. The overall CGMD strategy used here is general and can be applied to study the homo- and heterodimerization of GPCRs and other transmembrane proteins. Systematic extension of the work will deepen our understanding of the forces involved in the membrane organization of integral membrane proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {Alpha-synuclein remains a protein of interest due to its propensity to form fibrillar aggregates in neurodegenerative disease and its putative function in synaptic vesicle regulation. Herein, we present a series of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type alpha-synuclein and three Parkinson disease familial mutants (A30P, A53T, and E46K) in two distinct environments. First, in order to match recent NMR experiments, we have simulated each protein bound to an SDS detergent micelle. Second, in order to connect more closely to the true biological environment, we have simulated the proteins bound to a 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoserine lipid bilayer. In the micelle-bound case, we find that the wild type and all of the variants of alpha-synuclein flatten the underlying micelle, decreasing its surface area. A30P is known to lessen alpha-synuclein/membrane affinity and, consistent with experiment, destabilizes the simulated secondary structure. In the case of A53T, our simulations reveal a range of stabilizing hydrogen bonds that form with the threonine. In both environments, the E46K mutation, which is known to increase bilayer affinity, leads to an additional hydrogen bond between the protein and either the detergent or lipid. Simulations indicate that alphaS and its variants are less dynamic in the bilayer than in the micelle. Furthermore, the simulations of the mutants suggest how changes in the structure and dynamics of alpha-synuclein may affect its biological role.},

  Abstract                 = {Great progress has been made in applying coarse-grain molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations to the investigation of membrane biophysics. In order to validate the accuracy of CGMD simulations of membranes, atomistic scale detail is necessary for direct comparison to structural experiments. Here, we present our strategy for verifying CGMD lipid bilayer simulations. Through reverse coarse graining and subsequent calculation of the bilayer electron density profile, we are able to compare the simulations to our experimental low angle X-ray scattering (LAXS) data. In order to determine the best match to the experimental data, atomistic simulations are run at a range of areas (in the NP(N)AT ensemble), starting from distinct configurations extracted from the CGMD simulation (run in the NPT ensemble). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this procedure with two small, single-component bilayers, and suggest that the greater utility of our algorithm will be for CGMD simulations of more complex structures.},

The free energy of reduction, which is proportional to EÂ°, is composed of an intrinsic contribution due to the redox site and an environmental contribution due to the protein and solvent. Here, the intrinsic contribution is selected from a library of pre-calculated density functional theory values for each type of redox site and redox couple, while the environmental contribution is calculated from a crystal structure of the protein using Poisson-Boltzmann continuum electrostatics. An accompanying lesson demonstrates a calculation of EÂ°. In this lesson, an ionizable residue in a [4Fe-4S]-protein that causes a pH-dependent EÂ° is identified, and the EÂ° of a mutant that would test the identification is predicted. This demonstration is valuable to both computational chemistry students and researchers interested in predicting sequence determinants of EÂ° for mutagenesis.},

Population models of the evolutionary genetics of resistance have cast doubt on this claim. We document the experimental evolution of resistance to a cationic antimicrobial peptide through continued selection in the laboratory. In this selection experiment, 22/24 lineages of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens independently evolved heritable mechanisms of resistance to pexiganan, an analogue of magainin, when propagated in medium supplemented with this antimicrobial peptide for 600-700 generations.},

The mechanism proposed for this reaction involves formation of the radical cation of 1b cis by photoinduced electron transfer to the singlet excited state of 2, deprotonation of the radical cation assisted by the base 3, reduction of the resulting benzylic radical by the radical anion 2.-, and reprotonation of the benzylic anion to give both the cis and the trans isomers of 1b. The photostationary state is controlled by the relative rates of deprotonation of the radical cations of 1b cis and trans; these rates are dependent upon the extent of overlap of the SOMO of the radical cation, which is largely associated with the phenyl ring, and the benzylic carbon-hydrogen bond. Molecular mechanics calculations (MM3 and MMP2) are used to calculate the preferred conformations of the isomers. The required orbital overlap is 31 % effective with the global minimum conformation of the cis isomer and essentially ineffective for the low-lying conformations of the trans isomer. This proposed mechanism is supported by Stern-Volmer quenching studies, which indicate that both isomers quench the singlet excited state of 2 at the diffusion-controlled rate, and by deuterium incorporation studies. When irradiation of the cis isomer is carried out in acetonitrile-methanol-O-d as solvent, isomerization is accompanied by deuterium exchange at the benzylic position, the trans isomer is stable under these conditions.},

Because of the experimental difficulty of selectively probing the structure and dynamics of water in intact cells, radically different views about the properties of cell water have proliferated. To resolve this long-standing controversy, we have measured the 2H spin relaxation rate in living bacteria cultured in D2O. The relaxation data, acquired in a wide magnetic field range (0.2 mT-12 T) and analyzed in a model-independent way, reveal water dynamics on a wide range of time scales. Contradicting the view that a substantial fraction of cell water is strongly perturbed, we find that {approx}85\% of cell water in Escherichia coli and in the extreme halophile Haloarcula marismortui has bulk-like dynamics. The remaining {approx}15\% of cell water interacts directly with biomolecular surfaces and is motionally retarded by a factor 15 {+/-} 3 on average, corresponding to a rotational correlation time of 27 ps. This dynamic perturbation is three times larger than for small monomeric proteins in solution, a difference we attribute to secluded surface hydration sites in supramolecular assemblies. The relaxation data also show that a small fraction ({approx}0.1\%) of cell water exchanges from buried hydration sites on the microsecond time scale, consistent with the current understanding of protein hydration in solutions and crystals. 10.1073/pnas.0709585105},

Do they result from the intrinsic chirality of the polyene chromophore of the protonated Schiff base of retinal (retPSB) or from the coupling of the transitions of this chromophore with those of protein groups? We have calculated the contributions of these two mechanisms to the CD of rhodopsin. The intrinsic CD of the retPSB chromophore was calculated using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and, for comparison, the semiempirical ZINDO method. First-order perturbation theory was used to calculate the effects of coupling of the retPSB transitions with the \`{A}\`{A}* transitions of the aromatic chromophores and the \`{A}\`{A}* and n\`{A}* transitions of the peptide groups in rhodopsin. Calculations were performed for eight structures based upon the two molecules in the asymmetric unit of four crystal structures. The most reliable results were obtained from TDDFT calculations on the structure of Okada et al. (J. Mol. Biol. 2004, 342, 571), PDB 1U19. Averaging over the two molecules in the asymmetric unit, the intrinsic rotational strengths are 0.62 0.00 DBM (DebyeBohr magneton) and 0.90 0.03 DBM for the ÃÂ±- and ÃÂ²-bands, respectively. The contributions from coupling with protein groups are, respectively, 0.32 0.05 and 0.01 0.03 DBM. Our results show that the visible/near-UV CD bands of rhodopsin are determined by the intrinsic chirality of the retPSB chromophore and that the contributions of coupling with the protein are significantly smaller for the ÃÂ±-band and negligible for the ÃÂ²-band.},

  annotation = {The liquid drop (LD) model is revisited to assess the reliability of its predictions for thermodynamic properties of cluster ions and to examine the rate of convergence of such properties to their bulk counterparts. The model predictions are in very good agreement with both available experimental data and simulation results for Na+(H2O)(n) clusters, surprisingly for all cluster sizes, and the stepwise cluster thermodynamic properties are found to converge only slowly to their bulk counterparts. The LD model allows a natural partitioning of the cluster ion thermodynamic properties into various components, one of which (the solvation part) is of prime importance in connecting cluster solvation properties to the bulk limit. The latter LD model component is found to be entirely analogous to the so-called dielectric sphere theory, and as implied in earlier work, the results of dielectric models suggest that ion solvation is also a very slow process to converge to the bulk limit. In addition, a form alternative to the customary interior ion LD model is proposed, where the ion resides at the surface of a solvent droplet, and the resulting model successfully predicts that surface ion I-(H2O), clusters are thermodynamically very likely and that large halide ions tend to be located, if not at the surface, very close to it in large clusters of polar solvent molecules. Conversely, small ions such as Na+ are predicted to be interior in water clusters. Further, large ions such as I- are predicted to have interior but near-surface locations in acetonitrile clusters. Even though it seems to work better for smaller ions and solvents such as water, the LD model, despite its simplicity, generally appears to properly describe cluster ion thermodynamic properties over a wide range of cluster sizes and even for relatively small cluster sizes.},

  Abstract                 = {Deuterium ((2)H) NMR spectroscopy provides detailed information regarding the structural fluctuations of lipid bilayers, including both the equilibrium properties and dynamics. Experimental (2)H NMR measurements for the homologous series of 1, 2-diacyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholines with perdeuterated saturated chains (from C12:0 to C18:0) have been performed on randomly oriented, fully hydrated multilamellar samples. For each lipid, the C-D bond order parameters have been calculated from de-Paked (2)H NMR spectra as a function of temperature. The experimental order parameters were analyzed using a mean-torque potential model for the acyl chain segment distributions, and comparison was made with the conventional diamond lattice approach. Statistical mechanical principles were used to relate the measured order parameters to the lipid bilayer structural parameters: the hydrocarbon thickness and the mean interfacial area per lipid. At fixed temperature, the area decreases with increasing acyl length, indicating increased van der Waals attraction for longer lipid chains. However, the main effect of increasing the acyl chain length is on the hydrocarbon thickness rather than on the area per lipid. Expansion coefficients of the structural parameters are reported and interpreted using an empirical free energy function that describes the force balance in fluid bilayers. At the same absolute temperature, the phosphatidylcholine (PC) series exhibits a universal chain packing profile that differs from that of phosphatidylethanolamines (PE). Hence, the lateral packing of phospholipids is more sensitive to the headgroup methylation than to the acyl chain length. A fit to the area per lipid for the PC series using the empirical free energy function shows that the PE area represents a limiting value for the packing of fluid acyl chains.},

Analysis of the trajectories in four different lipids reveals how lipid chain length and saturation modulate the structural and energetic properties of transmembrane helices. Helix tilt, helix-helix crossing angle, and helix accessible volume depend on lipid type in a manner consistent with hydrophobic matching concepts: the most relevant lipid property appears to be the bilayer thickness. Although the net helix-helix interaction enthalpy is strongly attractive, analysis of residue-residue interactions reveals significant unfavorable electrostatic repulsion between interfacial glycine residues previously shown to be critical for dimerization. Peptide volume is nearly conserved upon dimerization in all lipid types, indicating that the monomeric helices pack equally well with lipid as dimer helices do with one another. Enthalpy calculations indicate that the helix-environment interaction energy is lower in the dimer than in the monomer form, when solvated by unsaturated lipids. In all lipid environments there is a marked preference for lipids to interact with peptide predominantly through one rather than both acyl chains. Although our trajectories are not long enough to allow a full thermodynamic treatment, these results demonstrate that molecular dynamics simulations are a powerful method for investigating the protein-protein, protein-lipid, and lipid-lipid interactions that determine the structure, stability and dynamics of transmembrane alpha-helices in membranes.},

  Abstract                 = {Membrane protein structure and function are influenced by the interaction with the lipid bilayer environment. The lipid bilayer structure and dynamics are in turn perturbed by the protein insertion. To study this mechanism, a number of experimental studies have used a series of model peptides (WALP) which consist of sequences of alternating alanine and leucine amino acids terminated by a pair of tryptophans at both ends. It has been shown that, due to hydrophobic mismatch, these peptides can assume tilted conformations with respect to the bilayer normal and also perturb the bilayer thickness. In an attempt to rationalize experimental results we performed a series of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations comprising five WALP lengths (16, 17, 19, 21, and 23 residues) and two lipid types (dimyristoyl- and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine). The peptide:lipid ratio was in all cases 1:30. We find that the bilayer boundary thickness increases monotonically with WALP length, as expected based on the WALP hydrophobicity. Other structural properties, including peptide tilt, appear to also be modulated by the tryptophan arrangement around the helical axis. These results suggest an important role for tryptophan-environment interactions in both microscopic and mesoscopic properties of the lipid bilayer. We discuss the role of the lipid bilayer density gradient on the dynamic structure of the peptide-lipid bilayer system and show the dependence of peptide side chain interactions and side chain volumes on the location along the bilayer normal. We find that WALP sequences with the tryptophan residues on opposite sides of the helix have an overall looser packing with the surrounding lipids and larger peptide tilts than peptides with the tryptophans on the same side.}

  Abstract                 = {The bradykinin receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is coupled to the Galpha(q) family of heterotrimeric G proteins. In general, a GPCR can exert intracellular signals either by transiently associating with multiple diffusing G protein subunits or by activating a G protein that is stably bound to the receptor, thus generating a signal that is limited by the stoichiometry of the complex. Here we have distinguished between these models by monitoring the association of type 2 bradykinin receptor (B(2)R) and the Galpha(q)/Gbetagamma heterotrimer in living human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing fluorescent-tagged proteins. Stable B(2)R-Galpha(q) x Gbetagamma complexes are observed in resting cells by fluorescence resonance energy transfer from either Galpha(q)-eCFP or eCFP-Gbetagamma to B(2)R-eYFP. Stimulating the cells with bradykinin causes detachment of B(2)R from the G protein subunits as the receptor internalizes into early endosomes, with a corresponding elimination of B(2)R-G protein fluorescence resonance energy transfer because Galpha(q) and its associated Gbetagamma remain on the plasma membrane. Single point and scanning fluorescence correlation spectroscopy measurements show that a portion of B(2)R molecules diffuses with a mobility corresponding to dimers or small oligomers, whereas a second fraction diffuses in higher order molecular assemblies. Our studies support a model in which receptors are pre-coupled with their corresponding G proteins in the basal state of cells thereby limiting the response to an external signal to a defined stoichiometry that allows for a rapid and directed cellular response.},

  Abstract                 = {NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems. NAMD scales to hundreds of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed. Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl scripting language. The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software BioCoRE.

The energetics of the synthesis of molecular sieves (considering all components present in the synthesis mixture) are examined and reveal small differences between various molecular sieve/SDA combinations. Assuming complete transformation of the starting amorphous silica into a molecular sieve, the Gibbs free energy changes for the crystallization are *BEA/TEA, -8.5 +/- 2.9 kJ/mol SiO2; MFI/TEA, -4.9 +/- 2.8 kJ/mol SiO2; and MFI/TPA, -8.1 +/- 2.8 kJ/mol SiO2. No single factor (enthalpy, entropy, etc.) dominates the overall Gibbs free energies, and these small energetic differences suggest that kinetic factors are of major importance in molecular sieve preparation.},

While widely used to model various biophysical processes, such as protein folding and aggregation, CG models can also serve as an educational tool because they can provide qualitative descriptions of complex biophysical phenomena for a relatively cheap computational cost. As a proof of concept, this lesson demonstrates the construction of a CG model of a small globular protein, its simulation via Langevin dynamics, and the analysis of the resulting data. This lesson makes connections between modern molecular simulation techniques and topics commonly presented in an advanced undergraduate lecture on physical chemistry. It culminates in a straightforward analysis of a short dynamics trajectory of a small fast folding globular protein; we briefly describe the thermodynamic properties that can be calculated from this analysis. The assumptions inherent in the model and the data analysis are laid out in a clear, concise manner, and the techniques used are consistent with those employed by specialists in the field of CG modeling. One of the major tasks in building the GÅ-like model is determining the relative strength of the nonbonded interactions between coarse-grained sites. New functionality has been added to CHARMMing to facilitate this process. The implementation of these features into CHARMMing helps automate many of the tedious aspects of constructing a CG GÅ model. The CG model builder and its accompanying lesson should be a valuable tool to chemistry students, teachers, and modelers in the field.},

The CFMC method has the advantages of our earlier potential- smoothing methods tin that it 'coarse-grains' the conformational space and exploits information about nearby low- energy states), but avoids their disadvantages (such as the displacement of the global minimum at large smoothings). The CFMC method is applied to a test protein, domain B of Staphylococcal protein A. Independent CFMC runs yielded the same low-energy families of conformations from random starts indicating that the thermodynamically relevant conformational space of this protein has been explored thoroughly.

This is achieved by coupling the superbasins in the original surface to basins in a highly deformed energy surface (which contains a significantly reduced number of minima, compared to the original rugged energy surface). The distance scaling method (DSM) and the diffusion equation method (DEM) have been implemented to carry out the deformation. The procedure consists of macroiterations in which the parameter a, that controls the deformation, changes between two extreme values, a(max) and a(min) (a=0 corresponds to the original energy surface). The first macroiteration is initialized by imposing a maximum deformation on the original surface and then selecting 10 randomly generated conformations in the maximally deformed surface, whose energies are then minimized, usually leading to less than 10 minima; the next macroiterations are fed with the results of the previous ones. Each macroiteration consists of the following steps: (i) reversal of the deformation from a(max) to a(min); a limited search is carried out in the neighborhood of the minima at each stage of the reversal; (ii) collection of the new low-energy minima in the a(min)-deformed energy surface; (iii) back-tracking these minima up to a,,, while increasing the deformation. Steps i - iii are iterated until no new minima are found in the undeformed surface, or a predefined number of iterations is exceeded. In the initial macroiteration, a(min), is greater than 0, and a,, is chosen so that the deformed energy surface has only a few minima. In each next macroiteration, the new a(max) is set at a(min) of the previous macroiteration, and a(min), is decreased, to reach 0 in the last macroiteration. The method was applied to united- residue polyalanine chains with a length of up to 100 amino acid residues, and to locate low-energy conformations of the 10-55 fragment of the B-domain of staphylococcal protein A.},

The results of the predictions serve as tests for evaluating the two potentials and may serve as a guide for potential refinements. Another important goal of this study was to clarify the role of the dipole moment contribution in calculations of the crystal electrostatic energy when the dipole moment of the unit cell is nonzero. Contrary to some practices, it is suggested that the use of the Ewald summation formula alone, without correcting for the dipole moment of the unit cell, is not the proper way to compute the electrostatic energy of a crystal and may lead to wrong predictions.},

  Abstract                 = {We have modelled hydrogen bond formation in phospholipid bilayers formed, in excess water, from lipids with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) headgroups. The hydrogen bonds are formed between the NH3+ group and either of the PO2- or the (sn2 chain) C=O groups. We used a model that represented the conformational states accessible to a PE headgroup by 17 states and modelled lipid dipole-dipole interactions using a non-local electrostatics theory to include the effects of hydrogen bonding in the aqueous medium. We used Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate equilibrium thermodynamic properties of bilayers in the fluid (T = 340 K) or gel (T = 300 K) phases of the bilayer. We defined Eh to be the difference in free energy between a hydrogen bond formed between a pair of lipid groups, and the energy of hydrogen bonds formed between water and those two groups, and we required its average value, [Eh], to be approximately -0.3kcal/mol (approximately -0.2 X 10(-13) erg) as reported by T.-B. Shin, R. Leventis, J.R. Silvius, Biochemistry 30 (1991) 7491. We found: (i) Eh = -0.9 X 10(-13) erg gave [Eh] = -0.21 X 10(-13) erg (gel phase) and [Eh] = -0.19 X 10(-13) erg (fluid phase). (ii) The relative number of C=O groups on the sn2 chain calculated to take part in interlipid hydrogen bonding in the fluid phase compared to the gel is 1.06 which compares well with the experimental ratio of approximately 1.25 (R.N.A.H. Lewis, R.N. McElhaney, Biophys. J. 64 (1993) 1081). The ratio of such groups taking part in interlipid hydrogen bonding compared to water hydrogen bonding in each phase was calculated to lie between 0.16 and 0.17. (iii) We calculated the distribution of positions of the headgroup moieties, P, O, CH2(alpha), CH2(beta) and N, and found that, in both phases, the O lay furthest from the hydrocarbon chain layer (average approximately 5.3A) with the PO2 and NH3 groups lying at approximately 5A. This results in the P-N dipole lying nearly parallel to the bilayer plane in both phases. The thickness of the headgroup layer underwent essentially no change on going from the gel to the fluid phase. The 2H NMR quadrupole splittings for the alpha and beta CH2 groups were 4.9 and 5.7kHz (fluid phase) and 7.1 and 7.3 kHz (gel phase), respectively, on the assumption of sufficiently rapid rotation around the z-axis. (iv) In both phases, the location of the NH3+ group exhibited a strong peak around 5.2 A into the aqueous medium, with much smaller peaks around 2.6 and 7.8 A, the two CH2 groups exhibited narrower, double-peaked distributions and the O and the PO2 each exhibited a narrow single peak. (v) PE headgroups, in a homogeneous gel phase, exhibited dipolar orientational long-range order in the plane of the bilayer. The distribution of orientation angles exhibited a full width at half height of between approximately 40 degrees and approximately 50 degrees. In a fluid phase no such order was observed. (vi) The number of hydrogen bonds did not differ substantially between the fluid and gel phases. This model is unlikely to display any significant effect of hydrogen bonding upon the "main" hydrocarbon chain melting phase transition at Tm, except, possibly, a broadening of any hysteresis, compared to the case of PC bilayers where interlipid hydrogen bonding is absent.},

The simulation demonstrates that the protein breaks the lateral and transverse symmetry of the bilayer. Lipids near the protein preferentially reorient such that their unsaturated chains interact with the protein, while the distribution of cholesterol in the membrane complements the variations in rhodopsin's transverse profile. The latter phenomenon suggests a molecular-level mechanism for the experimental finding that cholesterol stabilizes the native dark-adapted state of rhodopsin without binding directly to the protein.},

We have used the most accurate and recent values for these properties, and this report provides 56 Gibbs energy of solvation values in aqueous solution and 30 in DMSO solution. Our results support the general view that anions are much better solvated in aqueous solution than in DMSO. An important example is the hydroxide ion for which the Gibbs energy of transfer from water to DMSO is 26 kcal mol(-1). The majority of anions have a Gibbs energy of transfer in the range 10 to 15 kcal mol(-1). In the case of cations, DMSO has a larger solvation ability but the difference in the Gibbs energy of solvation between water and DMSO is not greater than 5 kcal mol(-1). The present data can be very useful for the development of continuum solvation models.},

  Abstract                 = {As access to computational resources continues to increase, free-energy calculations have emerged as a powerful tool that can play a predictive role in a wide range of research areas. Yet, the reliability of these calculations can often be improved significantly if a number of precepts, or good practices, are followed. Although the theory upon which these good practices rely has largely been known for many years, it is often overlooked or simply ignored. In other cases, the theoretical developments are too recent for their potential to be fully grasped and merged into popular platforms for the computation of free-energy differences. In this contribution, the current best practices for carrying out free-energy calculations using free energy perturbation and nonequilibrium work methods are discussed, demonstrating that at little to no additional cost, free-energy estimates could be markedly improved and bounded by meaningful error estimates. Monitoring the probability distributions that underlie the transformation between the states of interest, performing the calculation bidirectionally, stratifying the reaction pathway, and choosing the most appropriate paradigms and algorithms for transforming between states offer significant gains in both accuracy and precision.},

  Abstract                 = {Delta-lysin is a 26-residue, amphipathic, alpha-helical peptide of bacterial origin. Its specificity is to some extent complementary to that of antimicrobial peptides. Therefore, understanding its mechanism is important for the more general goal of understanding the interaction of amphipathic peptides with membranes. In this article, we show that delta-lysin induces graded efflux of the contents of phosphatidylcholine vesicles. In view of this finding, carboxyfluorescein efflux kinetics were re-examined. In addition, peptide-induced lipid flip-flop was directly measured using fluorescence energy transfer between two lipid fluorophores initially placed on opposite leaflets of the bilayer. Carboxyfluorescein efflux and lipid flip-flop occur with essentially identical rate constants. On the basis of a detailed, quantitative analysis of the kinetics of peptide-vesicle interactions, we conclude that the peptide translocates across the bilayer as a small, transient aggregate, most likely a trimer. Dye efflux and lipid flip-flop occur concomitantly with the transient peptide-induced perturbation of the membrane. The experimental data are interpreted by comparing the predictions of the available models for the mechanism of action of amphipathic alpha-helical peptides. We demonstrate how the combination of the quantitative kinetic analysis, graded efflux, and reversibility of the peptide-vesicle interaction can be used to reject several models for this particular peptide. Two models are compatible with the data, the toroidal pore model and the sinking raft model. On the basis of the small aggregate size, a trimer, the latter appears to be more plausible. Some significant modifications are introduced in the sinking raft model to take into account the new finding of graded dye release. Furthermore, we present an explanation for the phenomenon of graded release in general, which, contrary to all-or-none efflux, has not been well-understood.},

Dye efflux and peptide binding were examined for three homologous lipid series: di-monounsaturated, di-polyunsaturated, and asymmetric phosphatidylcholines, with one saturated and one monounsaturated acyl chain. Except for the third series, peptide activity correlated with the first moment of the lateral pressure profile, which is a function of lipid acyl chain structure. In vesicles composed of asymmetric phosphatidylcholines, peptide binding and dye efflux are enhanced compared to symmetric, unsaturated lipids with similar pressure profiles. We attribute this to the entropically more favorable interaction of{delta} -lysin with partially saturated phospholipids.

Among the most notable examples is penetratin (pAntp), a short cell-penetrating peptide. To delineate the driving forces behind pAntpÃ¢ÂÂmembrane interactions, we used, in this series of two papers, a combined modeling approach that includes: (1) molecular dynamics simulations of pAntp in zwitterionic and anionic lipid bilayers, (2) free energy perturbation calculations of model residueÃ¢ÂÂresidue contacts, and (3) detailed analysis of spatial hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of the peptide/membrane systems. In this first article, we consider the role of conformational plasticity of the peptide in different membrane surroundings, as well as the ability of pAntp to form stable specific residueÃ¢ÂÂresidue interactions and make contacts with particular lipids. It was shown that pAntp displays a complicated conformational behavior. Basic and aromatic residues of the peptide form energetically favorable pairs in water and apolar environments, which facilitate membrane insertion of the peptide and stabilization of the membrane-bound state. These residues are also capable of Ã¢ÂÂtrappingÃ¢ÂÂ lipid heads, thereby affecting their dynamics and microscopic organization of the waterÃ¢ÂÂlipid interface. The latter effect is much more pronounced in anionic bilayers and might be related to the initial stage of peptide-induced destabilization of lipid bilayers.},

  Abstract                 = {The molecular mechanism for proton conduction along hydrogen-bonded chains, or "proton wires," is studied with free energy simulations. The complete transport of a charge along a proton wire requires two complementary processes: 1) translocation of an excess proton (propagation of an ionic defect), and 2) reorientation of the hydrogen-bonded chain (propagation of a bonding defect). The potential of mean force profile for these two steps is computed in model systems comprising a single-file chain of nine dissociable and polarizable water molecules represented by the PM6 model of Stillinger and co-workers. Results of molecular dynamics simulations with umbrella sampling indicate that the unprotonated chain is preferably polarized, and that the inversion of its total dipole moment involves an activation free energy of 8 kcal/mol. In contrast, the rapid translocation of an excess H+ across a chain extending between two spherical solvent droplets is an activationless process. These results suggest that the propagation of a bonding defect constitutes a limiting step for the passage of several protons along single-file chains of water molecules, whereas the ionic translocation may be fast enough to occur within the lifetime of transient hydrogen-bonded water chains in biological membranes.},

  abstract     = {The application of coarse-grained (CG) models in biology is essential to access large length and time scales required for the description of many biological processes. The ELNEDIN protein model is based on the well-known MARTINI CG force-field and incorporates additionally harmonic bonds of a certain spring constant within a defined cutoff distance between pairs of residues, in order to preserve the native structure of the protein. In this case, the use of unbreakable harmonic bonds hinders the study of unfolding and folding processes. To overcome this barrier we have replaced the harmonic bonds with Lennard-Jones interactions based on the contact map of the native protein structure as is done in GoÌ-like models. This model exhibits very good agreement with all-atom simulations and the ELNEDIN. Moreover, it can capture the structural motion linked to particular catalytic activity in the Man5B protein, in agreement with all-atom simulations. In addition, our model is based on the van der Waals radii, instead of a cutoff distance, which results in a smaller contact map. In conclusion, we anticipate that our model will provide further possibilities for studying biological systems based on the MARTINI CG force-field by using advanced-sampling methods, such as parallel tempering and metadynamics.},

These properties are the actual mobilities (that of the fully ionised weak bases), and their py values. Actual mobilities were measured in acidic methanolic solutions containing perchloric acid. The ionisation constants of the amines were derived from the dependence of the ionic mobilities on the pH of the background electrolyte solution. The pH scale in methanol was established from acids with known conventional pK(a)*, values in this solvent used as buffers, avoiding thus further adjustment with a pH sensitive electrode that might bias the scale. Actual mobilities in methanol were found larger than in water, and do not correlate well with the solvent's viscosity. The pK(a)*, values of the cation acids, HB+, the corresponding form of the base, B, are higher in methanol, whereas a less pronounced shift was found than for neutral acids of type HA. The mean increase (compared to pure aqueous solution) for aliphatic ammonium type analytes is 1.8, for substituted anilinium 1.1, and for aromatic ammonium from pyridinium type 0.5 units. The interpretation of this shift was undertaken with the concept of the medium effect on the particles involved in the acid-base equilibrium: the proton, the molecular base, B, and the cation HB+.

  abstract             = {The effect of channel length on the barrier for potassium ion permeation through single-file channels has been studied by means of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. Using series of peptidic gramicidin-like and simplified ring-structured channels, both embedded in model membranes, we obtained two distinct types of behavior: saturation of the central free energy barriers for peptidic channels and a linear increase in simplified ring-structured channels with increasing channel length. The saturation of the central free energy barrier for the peptidic channels occurs at relatively short lengths, and it is correlated with the desolvation from the bulk water. Remarkably, decomposition of free energy barriers into enthalpic and entropic terms reveals an entropic cost for ion permeation. Furthermore, this entropic cost dominates the ion permeation free energy barrier, since the corresponding free energy contribution is higher than the enthalpic barrier. We conclude that the length dependence of the free energy is enthalpy-dominated, but the entropy is the major contribution to the permeation barrier. The decrease in rotational water motion and the reduction of channel mobility are putative origins for the overall entropic penalty. 10.1529/biophysj.108.130609},

  abstract =    {Rhodopsin receptor activation involves the disruption of a salt bridge constraint between glutamic acid 113 on transmembrane 3 and a lysine 296 in transmembrane 7, which forms a Schiff's base with retinal. Light-induced isomerization of cis-retinal to the all trans form breaks this rhodopsin salt bridge leading to receptor activation. The analogous residues in alpha1b-adrenergic receptors, aspartic acid 125 and lysine 331, also have the potential of forming a constraining salt bridge holding the receptor to an inactive protein configuration. This alpha1b-adrenergic receptor salt bridge constraint is then released upon binding by the receptor agonist. To test this hypothesis, site-directed mutagenesis was used to eliminate the positive charge at position 331 by substitution of an alanine. The expressed alpha1b-adrenergic receptor mutant demonstrated a 6-fold increased epinephrine binding affinity with no alterations of affinity values for selective adrenergic receptor antagonists. Furthermore, an increased epinephrine potency for total soluble inositol phosphate production along with an elevated basal inositol triphosphate level was observed in COS-1 cells transfected with mutant versus wild-type alpha1b-adrenergic receptors. Similar results were obtained for a lysine to a glutamic acid alpha1b-adrenergic receptor mutation. In addition, increased basal inositol triphosphate levels were also observed for two aspartic acid 125 alpha1b-adrenergic receptor mutations, consistent with this residue's role as the counterion of the salt bridge. Taken together, these alpha1b-adrenergic receptor mutations suggest a molecular mechanism by which the positively charged lysine 331 stabilizes the negatively charged aspartic acid 125 via a salt bridge constraint until bound by the receptor agonist.},

The problem is tackled here by means of a novel variational approach that exploits information about equilibrium fluctuations of interresidues distances, provided, e.g., by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations or coarse-grained models. No contiguity in primary sequence or in space is enforced a priori for amino acids grouped in the same rigid unit. The identification of the rigid protein moduli, or dynamical domains, provides valuable insight into functionally oriented aspects of protein internal dynamics. To illustrate this point, we first discuss the decomposition of adenylate kinase and HIV-1 protease and then extend the investigation to several representatives of the hydrolase enzymatic class. The known catalytic site of these enzymes is found to be preferentially located close to the boundary separating the two primary dynamical subdomains.},

The results reveal that the volume of the rod outer segment is proportional to rhodopsin gene expression; that P23H-rhodopsin, the most common rhodopsin gene disease allele, causes cell death via a dominant-negative mechanism; and that long term survival of rod cells carrying P23H-rhodopsin can be achieved by increasing the levels of wild type rhodopsin.

  abstract             = {Motivated by a quasi-chemical view of protein hydration, we define specific hydration sites on the surface of globular proteins in terms of the local water density at each site relative to bulk water density. The corresponding kinetic definition invokes the average residence time for a water molecule at each site and the average time that site remains unoccupied. Bound waters are identified by high site occupancies using either definition. In agreement with previous molecular dynamics simulation studies, we find only a weak correlation between local water densities and water residence times for hydration sites on the surface of two globular proteins, lysozyme and staphylococcal nuclease. However, a strong correlation is obtained when both the average residence and vacancy times are appropriately taken into account. In addition, two distinct kinetic regimes are observed for hydration sites with high occupancies: long residence times relative to vacancy times for a single water molecule, and short residence times with high turnover involving multiple water molecules. We also correlate water dynamics, characterized by average occupancy and vacancy times, with local heterogeneities in surface charge and surface roughness, and show that both features are necessary to obtain sites corresponding to kinetically bound waters. 10.1529/biophysj.108.133553},

  abstract    = {Molecular simulation has historically been a low-throughput technique, but faster computers and increasing amounts of genomic and structural data are changing this by enabling large-scale automated simulation of, for instance, many conformers or mutants of biomolecules with or without a range of ligands. At the same time, advances in performance and scaling now make it possible to model complex biomolecular interaction and function in a manner directly testable by experiment. These applications share a need for fast and efficient software that can be deployed on massive scale in clusters, web servers, distributed computing or cloud resources.Here, we present a range of new simulation algorithms and features developed during the past 4 years, leading up to the GROMACS 4.5 software package. The software now automatically handles wide classes of biomolecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, and comes with all commonly used force fields for these molecules built-in. GROMACS supports several implicit solvent models, as well as new free-energy algorithms, and the software now uses multithreading for efficient parallelization even on low-end systems, including windows-based workstations. Together with hand-tuned assembly kernels and state-of-the-art parallelization, this provides extremely high performance and cost efficiency for high-throughput as well as massively parallel simulations.GROMACS is an open source and free software available from http://www.gromacs.org.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract =    {Extensive experimental information supports the formation of ligand-specific conformations of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as a possible molecular basis for their functional selectivity for signaling pathways. Taking advantage of the recently published inactive and active crystal structures of GPCRs, we have implemented an all-atom computational strategy that combines different adaptive biasing techniques to identify ligand-specific conformations along pre-determined activation pathways. Using the prototypic GPCR Î²2-adrenergic receptor as a suitable test case for validation, we show that ligands with different efficacies (either inverse agonists, neutral antagonists, or agonists) modulate the free-energy landscape of the receptor by shifting the conformational equilibrium towards active or inactive conformations depending on their elicited physiological response. Notably, we provide for the first time a quantitative description of the thermodynamics of the receptor in an explicit atomistic environment, which accounts for the receptor basal activity and the stabilization of different active-like states by differently potent agonists. Structural inspection of these metastable states reveals unique conformations of the receptor that may have been difficult to retrieve experimentally.},

However, for virtually all GPCRs, active agonist-bound intermediate states have been difficult to characterize experimentally owing to their higher conformational flexibility, and thus intrinsic instability, as compared to inactive inverse agonist-bound states. In this work, we explored possible activation pathways of the prototypic GPCR bovine rhodopsin by means of biased molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we used an explicit atomistic representation of the receptor and its environment, and sampled the conformational transition from the crystal structure of a photoactivated deprotonated state of rhodopsin to the low pH crystal structure of opsin in the presence of 11-trans-retinal, using adiabatic biased molecular dynamics simulations. We then reconstructed the system free-energy landscape along the predetermined transition trajectories using a path collective variable approach based on metadynamics. Our results suggest that the two experimental endpoints of rhodopsin/opsin are connected by at least two different pathways, and that the conformational transition is populated by at least four metastable states of the receptor, characterized by a different amplitude of the outward movement of transmembrane helix 6.},

Concentrations of the members of the antifungal lipopeptide families iturin A and fengycin were found to correlate positively with extract inhibition, but a peak with unidentified chemical composition (designated as peak 48) showed the strongest correlation with extract inhibition. HPLC data were used to construct models for the production of iturin A, fengycin, and peak 48 as a function of the substrate moisture content, incubator temperature, and aeration rate in the solid-state bioreactors. Maximum production of all compounds occurred at the highest moisture content (1.7 g/g dry basis) and lowest incubator temperature (19 degrees C) tested. Optimal aeration rates for the production of the two known lipopeptides and peak 48 were 0.1 and 1.5 L/min, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), an important angiogenesis factor, appears also to be involved in inflammatory processes. Recent studies have shown that VEGF and its receptors (VEGFR) are expressed on osteoarthritic, but not on normal adult, chondrocytes. To elucidate possible functions of VEGF in osteoarthritic cartilage, the effects of VEGF were studied on immortalized human chondrocytes. Activated matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-3, MMP-13, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1, TIMP-2, interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured in culture supernatants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, nitric oxide with the Griess reagent, and cell proliferation by [3H]thymidine incorporation. VEGFR-2 mRNA was quantified by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and the protein was identified by immuno-gold electron microscopy. Intracellular signal transduction effects were determined by western blots and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The chondrocyte cell lines C28/I2, C20/A4, and T/C28a2/a4 expressed functionally active VEGFR-2. VEGF stimulation induced receptor phosphorylation, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK 1/2, and long-lasting activation of the transcription factor AP-1 (activator protein-1). VEGF increased secreted MMP-1, MMP-3, and especially MMP-13, which could be effectively reduced by an inhibitor of VEGFR-2 kinase activity. Interestingly, VEGF diminished the expression of TIMP-1 and especially TIMP-2. Under hypoxic conditions, as occur in cartilage, the reduction in TIMP levels was even greater. Furthermore, VEGF induced IL-1beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and nitric oxide expression to a small extent and stimulated the proliferation of immortalized chondrocytes. These findings indicate that VEGF is an autocrine stimulator of immortalized chondrocytes that mediates mainly destructive processes in osteoarthritis.},

We prepared fully hydrated multiple bilayers of alamethicin-lipid mixtures in a condition pores were present as established previously by neutron in-plane scattering in correlation with oriented circular dichroism. At dehydrated conditions the inter-bilayer distance shortened and the interactions between bilayers caused the membrane pores to become long-ranged correlated and form a periodically ordered lattice of rhombohedral symmetry. To resolve the phase problem of diffraction, we used a brominated lipid and perform multiwavelength anomalous diffraction at the bromine K edge. The result unambiguously shows that the alamethicin pore is of the barrel-stave type consisting of 8 alamethicin helices. This pore structure corresponds to the stable pores detected by neutron in-plane scattering in fully hydrated fluid bilayers at high peptide-lipid ratios, which are the conditions alamethicin was tested for its antibacterial activity. 10.1529/biophysj.107.126474},

  Abstract                 = {We present molecular dynamics simulations of bovine rhodopsin in a membrane mimetic environment based on the recently refined X-ray structure of the pigment. The interactions between the protonated Schiff base and the protein moiety are explored both with the chromophore in the dark-adapted 11-cis and in the photoisomerized all-trans form. Comparison of simulations with Glu181 in different protonation states strongly suggests that this loop residue located close to the 11-cis bond bears a negative charge. Restrained molecular dynamics simulations also provide evidence that the protein tightly confines the absolute conformation of the retinal around the C12-C13 bond to a positive helicity. 11-cis to all-trans isomerization leads to an internally strained chromophore, which relaxes after a few nanoseconds by a switching of the ionone ring to an essentially planar all-trans conformation. This structural transition of the retinal induces in turn significant conformational changes of the protein backbone, especially in helix VI. Our results suggest a possible molecular mechanism for the early steps of intramolecular signal transduction in a prototypical G-protein-coupled receptor.},

NMR parameters are particularly sensitive to structural properties and to the chemical environment, which allows us to address different questions about the retinal chromophore in situ. Our calculations show that both the 13C and the 1H NMR chemical shifts are rather insensitive to the protonation state of Glu181, an ionizable amino acid side chain located in the vicinity of the isomerizing 11-cis bond. Thus, other techniques should be better suited to establish its protonation state. The calculated chemical shifts for bathorhodopsin further support our previously published theoretical structure, which is in very good agreement with more recent X-ray data.},

  Abstract                 = {Cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) are versatile molecules produced by a variety of bacterial genera, including plant-associated Pseudomonas spp. CLPs are composed of a fatty acid tail linked to a short oligopeptide, which is cyclized to form a lactone ring between two amino acids in the peptide chain. CLPs are very diverse both structurally and in terms of their biological activity. The structural diversity is due to differences in the length and composition of the fatty acid tail and to variations in the number, type, and configuration of the amino acids in the peptide moiety. CLPs have received considerable attention for their antimicrobial, cytotoxic, and surfactant properties. For plant-pathogenic Pseudomonas spp., CLPs constitute important virulence factors, and pore formation, followed by cell lysis, is their main mode of action. For the antagonistic Pseudomonas sp., CLPs play a key role in antimicrobial activity, motility, and biofilm formation. CLPs are produced via nonribosomal synthesis on large, multifunctional peptide synthetases. Both the structural organization of the CLP synthetic templates and the presence of specific domains and signature sequences within peptide synthetase genes will be described for both pathogenic and antagonistic Pseudomonas spp. Finally, the role of various genes and regulatory mechanisms in CLP production by Pseudomonas spp., including two-component regulation and quorum sensing, will be discussed in detail.},

The efficiency of host defense via AMPs derives from the ability of these peptides to quickly identify and eradicate foreign pathogens through precise biochemical mechanisms. Recent advances in this field have expanded the repertoire of activities for AMPs to include immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory capacity as a catalyst for secondary host defense mechanisms. Further scrutiny of the biochemical and regulatory mechanisms of AMPs will lead to novel alternative approaches to the treatment of human pathogenic disorders.},

Two-way pathways mediate the communication between the receptorÃ¢ÂÂG protein interface and both the agonist binding site of the receptor and the nucleotide binding site of the G protein. The increase in solvent accessibility in the neighborhoods of the highly conserved E/DRY receptor motif, in response to agonist binding, is instrumental in favoring the penetration of the C-terminus of GqÃÂ± in between the cytosolic ends of H3, H5, and H6. The arginine of the E/DRY motif is predicted to be an important mediator of the intramolecular and intermolecular communication involving the TXA2R. The receptorÃ¢ÂÂG protein interface is predicted to involve multiple regions from the receptor and the G protein ÃÂ±-subunit. However, receptor contacts with the C-terminus of the ÃÂ±5-helix seem to be the major players in the receptor-catalyzed motion of the ÃÂ±-helical domain with respect to the Ras-like domain and in the formation of a nucleotide exit route in between the ÃÂ±F-helix and ÃÂ²6/ÃÂ±5 loop of GqÃÂ±. The inferences from this study are of wide interest, as they are expected to apply to the whole rhodopsin family, given also the considerable G protein promiscuity.},

  abstract             = {-Secretase plays a critical role in -amyloid formation and thus provides a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease. Inhibitor design has usually focused on active-site binding, neglecting the subcellular localization of active enzyme. We have addressed this issue by synthesizing a membrane-anchored version of a -secretase transition-state inhibitor by linking it to a sterol moiety. Thus, we targeted the inhibitor to active -secretase found in endosomes and also reduced the dimensionality of the inhibitor, increasing its local membrane concentration. This inhibitor reduced enzyme activity much more efficiently than did the free inhibitor in cultured cells and in vivo. In addition to effectively targeting -secretase, this strategy could also be used in designing potent drugs against other membrane protein targets.

The folding is governed by minimization of energy based on Miyazawa-Jernigan contact potentials. Using this method we are able to substantially reduce the computation time on ordinary desktop computers for simulation of polypeptide folding starting from a fully unfolded state. We compare our results with available native state structures from Protein Data Bank (PDB) for a few de-novo proteins and two natural proteins, Ubiquitin and Lysozyme. Based on our simulations we are able to draw the energy landscape for a small de-novo protein, Chignolin. We also use two well known protein structure prediction software, MODELLER and GROMACS to compare our results. In the end, we show how a modification of normal elastic network model can lead to higher accuracy and lower time required for simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {There is a considerable current interest in understanding the function of antimicrobial peptides for the development of potent novel antibiotic compounds with a very high selectivity. Since their interaction with the cell membrane is the major driving force for their function, solid-state NMR spectroscopy is the unique method of choice to study these insoluble, non-crystalline, membrane-peptide complexes. Here I discuss solid-state NMR studies of antimicrobial peptides that have reported high-resolution structure, dynamics, orientation, and oligomeric states of antimicrobial peptides in a membrane environment, and also address important questions about the mechanism of action at atomic-level resolution. Increasing number of solid-state NMR applications to antimicrobial peptides are expected in the near future, as these compounds are promising candidates to overcome ever-increasing antibiotic resistance problem and are well suited for the development and applications of solid-state NMR techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Bacillus species are well known for their ability to control plant diseases through various mechanisms, including the production of secondary metabolites. Bacillus subtilis DFH08, an antagonist of Fusarium graminearum, and other Bacillus spp. that are antagonists of common fungal pathogens of canola were screened for peptide synthetase biosynthetic genes of fengycin and bacillomycin D. Specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers identified B. subtilis strains DFH08 and 49 for the presence of the fenD gene of the fengycin operon. Bacillus cereus DFE4, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens strains DFE16 and BS6, and B. subtilis 49 were identified for the presence of the bamC gene of the bacillomycin D synthetase biosynthetic operon. Both fengycin and bacillomycin D were detected in the culture extract of strain Bs49, characterized through MALDI-TOF-MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - time of flight - mass spectrometry), and their antifungal activities demonstrated against F. graminearum and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. This study designed and used specific PCR primers for the detection of potential fengycin- and bacillomycin D-producing bacterial antagonists and confirmed the molecular detection with the biochemical detection of the corresponding antibiotic produced. This is also the first report of a B. cereus strain (DFE4) to have bacillomycin D biosynthetic genes. Bacteria that synthesize these lipopeptides could act as natural genetic sources for genetic engineering of the peptide synthetases for production of novel peptides.},

  abstract    = {G protein coupled receptors have historically been one of the most druggable classes of cellular proteins. The members of this large receptor gene family couple to primary effectors, G proteins, that have built in mechanisms for regeneration and amplification of signaling with each engagement of receptor and ligand, a kinetic event in itself. In recent years GPCRs, have been found to interact with arrestin proteins to initiate signal propagation in the absence of G protein interactions. This pinnacle observation has changed a previously held notion of the linear spectrum of GPCR efficacy and uncovered a new paradigm in GPCR research and drug discovery that relies on multidimensionality of GPCR signaling. Ligands were found that selectively confer activity in one pathway over another, and this phenomenon has been referred to as 'biased agonism' or 'functional selectivity'. While great strides in the understanding of this phenomenon have been made in recent years, two critical questions still dominate the field: How can we rationally design biased GPCR ligands, and ultimately, which physiological responses are due to G protein versus arrestin interactions? This review will discuss the current understanding of some of the key aspects of biased signaling that are related to these questions, including mechanistic insights in the nature of biased signaling and methods for measuring ligand bias, as well as relevant examples of drug discovery applications and medicinal chemistry strategies that highlight the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly evolving field.},

  Abstract                 = {The hydrophobic interaction, the tendency for nonpolar molecules to aggregate in solution, is a major driving force in biology. In a direct approach to the physical basis of the hydrophobic effect, nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations were performed on increasing numbers of hydrocarbon solute molecules in water-filled boxes of different sizes. The intermittent formation of solute clusters gives a free energy that is proportional to the loss in exposed molecular surface area with a constant of proportionality of 45 +/- 6 cal/mol A(2). The molecular surface area is the envelope of the solute cluster that is impenetrable by solvent and is somewhat smaller than the more traditional solvent-accessible surface area, which is the area transcribed by the radius of a solvent molecule rolled over the surface of the cluster. When we apply a factor relating molecular surface area to solvent-accessible surface area, we obtain 24 cal/mol A(2). Ours is the first direct calculation, to our knowledge, of the hydrophobic interaction from molecular dynamics simulations; the excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with experiment proves that simple van der Waals interactions and atomic point-charge electrostatics account for the most important driving force in biology.},

Diffraction data were obtained by high-brilliance microcrystallography and the structure determined at 3.4 A/3.7 A resolution. The cytoplasmic ends of the beta2AR transmembrane segments and the connecting loops are well resolved, whereas the extracellular regions of the beta2AR are not seen. The beta2AR structure differs from rhodopsin in having weaker interactions between the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane (TM)3 and TM6, involving the conserved E/DRY sequences. These differences may be responsible for the relatively high basal activity and structural instability of the beta2AR, and contribute to the challenges in obtaining diffraction-quality crystals of non-rhodopsin GPCRs.},

  Abstract                 = {We recently described 10 peptides selected from a 16,384-member combinatorial library based on their ability to permeabilize synthetic lipid vesicles in vitro. These peptides did not share a common sequence motif, length, or net charge; nonetheless, they shared a mechanism of action that is similar to the natural membrane permeabilizing antimicrobial peptides (AMP). To characterize the selected peptides and to compare the activity of AMPs in vivo and in vitro, we report on the biological activity of the same selected peptides in bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. Each of the peptides has sterilizing activity against all classes of microbes tested, at 2-8 microM peptide, with only slight hemolytic or cytotoxicity against mammalian cells. Similar to many natural AMPs, bacteria are killed within a few minutes of peptide addition, and the lethal step in vivo is membrane permeabilization. Single D-amino acid substitutions eliminated or diminished the secondary structure of the peptides, and yet, they retained activity against some microbes. Thus, secondary structure and biological activity are not coupled, consistent with the hypothesis that AMPs do not form pores of well-defined structure in membranes but rather destabilize membranes by partitioning into membrane interfaces and disturbing the organization of the lipids, a property that we have called "interfacial activity". The observation that broad-spectrum activity, but not all antimicrobial activity, is lost by small changes to the peptides suggests that the in vitro screen is specifically selecting for the rare peptides that have broad-spectrum activity. We put forth the hypothesis that methods focusing on screening peptide libraries in vitro for members with the appropriate interfacial activity can enable the design, selection, and discovery of novel, potent, and broad-spectrum membrane-active antibiotics.},

We have hypothesized that this is due, in part, to the fact that some membrane activities, such as permeabilization, are not dependent on specific amino acid sequences or specific three-dimensional peptide structures. Instead they depend on interfacial activity: the ability of a molecule to partition into the membranewater interface and to alter the packing and organization of lipids. Here we test that idea by taking a nonclassical approach to biomolecular engineering and design of membrane-active peptides. A 16 384-member rational combinatorial peptide library, containing peptides of 915 amino acids in length, was screened for soluble members that permeabilize phospholipid membranes. A stringent, two-phase, high-throughput screen was used to identify 10 unique peptides that had potent membrane-permeabilizing activity but were also water soluble. These rare and uniquely active peptides do not share any particular sequence motif, peptide length, or net charge, but instead they share common compositional features, secondary structure, and core hydrophobicity. We show that they function by a common mechanism that depends mostly on interfacial activity and leads to transient pore formation. We demonstrate here that compositionspace peptide libraries coupled with function-based high-throughput screens can lead to the discovery of diverse, soluble, and highly potent membrane-permeabilizing peptides.},

  Abstract                 = {In a previous report we described the selection of potent, beta-sheet pore-forming peptides from a combinatorial library designed to mimic membrane-spanning beta-hairpins (Rausch, J. M., Marks, J. R., and Wimley, W. C. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 102, 10511-10515). Here, we characterize their mechanism of action and compare the structure-function relationships in lipid vesicles to their activity in biological membranes. The pore-forming peptides bind to membrane interfaces and self-assemble into beta-sheets that cause a transient burst of graded leakage across the bilayers. Despite the continued presence of the structured peptides in the bilayer, at most peptide concentrations leakage is incomplete and ceases quickly after peptide addition with a deactivation half-time of several minutes. Molecules up to 3,000 Da escape from the transient pores, but much larger molecules do not. Fluorescence spectroscopy and quenching showed that the peptides reside mainly on the bilayer surface and are partially exposed to water, rather than in a membrane-spanning state. The "carpet" or "sinking raft" model of peptide pore formation offers a viable explanation for our observations and suggests that the selected pore-formers function with a mechanism that is similar to the natural pore-forming antimicrobial peptides. We therefore also characterized the antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity of these peptides. All peptides studied, including non-pore-formers, had sterilizing antimicrobial activity against at least some microbes, and most have low activity against mammalian cell membranes. Thus, the structure-function relationships that were apparent in the vesicle systems are similar to, but do not correlate completely with, the activity of the same peptides in biological membranes. However, of the peptides tested, only the pore-formers selected in the high-throughput screen have potent, broad-spectrum sterilizing activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria as well as against fungi, while having only small lytic effects on human cells.},

  Abstract                 = {Exogenous polypeptides that self-assemble on biological membranes into pores are abundant and structurally diverse, functioning as transporters, toxins, ion channels, and antibiotics. A means for designing novel pore-forming sequences would unlock new opportunities for the development and engineering of protein function in membranes. Toward this goal, we designed a 9,604-member rational combinatorial peptide library based on the structural principles of known membrane-spanning beta-sheets. When the library was screened under stringent conditions for sequences with pore-forming activity, a single active motif was found, which is characterized by aromatic residues at the lipid-exposed interfacial positions and basic residues in the pore-lining portion of the sequence. Peptides with this motif assembled on bilayer membranes into beta-sheets and formed transient peptide/lipid pores of approximately 1-nm diameter. The mechanism of action is very similar to that of natural, pore-forming peptides. These methods provide a powerful means for selecting and engineering novel pore-forming sequences and will open prospects for designing peptide antibiotics, biosensors, and new membrane protein structures.},

  abstract    = {Proteins, which are bioactive molecules, adsorb on implants placed in the body through complex and poorly understood mechanisms and directly influence biocompatibility. Molecular dynamics modeling using empirical force fields provides one of the most direct methods of theoretically analyzing the behavior of complex molecular systems and is well-suited for the simulation of protein adsorption behavior. To accurately simulate protein adsorption behavior, a force field must correctly represent the thermodynamic driving forces that govern peptide residue-surface interactions. However, since existing force fields were developed without specific consideration of protein-surface interactions, they may not accurately represent this type of molecular behavior. To address this concern, we developed a host-guest peptide adsorption model in the form of a G(4)-X-G(4) peptide (G is glycine, X is a variable residue) to enable determination of the contributions to adsorption free energy of different X residues when adsorbed to functionalized Au-alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs). We have previously reported experimental results using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy to measure the free energy of peptide adsorption for this peptide model with X = G and K (lysine) on OH and COOH functionalized SAMs. The objectives of the present research were the development and assessment of methods to calculate adsorption free energy using molecular dynamics simulations with the GROMACS force field for these same peptide adsorption systems, with an oligoethylene oxide (OEG) functionalized SAM surface also being considered. By comparing simulation results to the experimental results, the accuracy of the selected force field to represent the behavior of these molecular systems can be evaluated. From our simulations, the G(4)-G-G(4) and G(4)-K-G(4) peptides showed minimal to no adsorption to the OH SAM surfaces and the G(4)-K-G(4) showed strong adsorption to the COOH SAM surface, which is in agreement with our SPR experiments. Contrary to our experimental results, however, the simulations predicted a relatively strong adsorption of G(4)-G-G(4) peptide to the COOH SAM surface. In addition, both peptides were unexpectedly predicted to adsorb to the OEG surface. These findings demonstrate the need for GROMACS force field parameters to be rebalanced for the simulation of peptide adsorption behavior on SAM surfaces. The developed methods provide a direct means of assessing, modifying, and validating force field performance for the simulation of peptide and protein adsorption to surfaces, without which little confidence can be placed in the simulation results that are generated with these types of systems.},

  annotation = {Properties of relatively new polymeric materials are capitalized upon to address a relatively old problem in electrochemistry, the comparison of electrode potentials measured in different solvents, In particular, electrode potentials measured in acetonitrile and in water are compared at voltammetrically relevant concentrations, Activity coefficients are measured for sih er perchlorate in acetonitrile using the isopiestic technique, These results are used to interpret the influence of silver perchlorate activity on apparent formal potentials measured in acetonitrile for an electrochemically polymerized redox polymer. Similar measurements are made on the same redox polymer in water, and in both solvents the cell potentials are Nernstian for a simple ionic stoichiometry. The cell potentials measured in acetonitrile are +0.244 V of those measured in water. This difference is consistent with the difference expected from estimates of the free energy of transfer of silver perchlorate. It is also consistent with predictions based on certain extrathermodynamic assumptions concerning the free energies of transfer of the single ions. The results reported here suggest that the free energy for transferring silver perchlorate from water to acetonitrile is -21.9 +/- 0.9 kJ/mol and that the potential of the Ag\a(AgClO4)(CH3CN) = 1 couple is -0.227 +/- 0.009 V of the Ag\a(AgClO4)H2O = 1 couple. The influence of electrolyte activity on formal potentials measured for redox couples dissolved in acetonitrile is also investigated. Our results demonstrate that internal reference couples such as ferrocene/ferrocenium should be used with caution. Over certain concentration ranges, ion pairing may play an important role in determining formal potentials measured for dissolved reference compounds. To provide a reliable set of values to which subsequent comparisons can be made in acetonitrile, we report apparent formal potentials as a function of electrolyte activity for several popular internal reference couples.},

The collision rate of the attached nitroxides with polar and nonpolar paramagnetic agents indicated that they were all exposed to the aqueous environment. Photobleaching of the mutants in digitonin, which arrests the protein at the meta I intermediate, produced little change in mobility of the attached nitroxide. On the other hand, photobleaching in lauryl maltoside produced the meta II intermediate and significant changes in the EPR spectra of the nitroxides attached to positions 140 and 316.

It has three general states: (I) soluble in water or (II) bound to the surface of a lipid bilayer as an unstructured monomer, and (III) inserted across the bilayer as a monomeric ÃÂ±-helix. We used fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry to study the interactions of pHLIP with a palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipid bilayer and to calculate the transition energies between states. We found that the Gibbs free energy of binding to a POPC surface at low pHLIP concentration (state IÃ¢ÂÂstate II transition) at 37ÃÂ°C is approximately Ã¢ÂÂ7 kcal/mol near neutral pH and that the free energy of insertion and folding across a lipid bilayer at low pH (state IIÃ¢ÂÂstate III transition) is nearly Ã¢ÂÂ2 kcal/mol. We discuss a number of related thermodynamic parameters from our measurements. Besides its fundamental interest as a model system for the study of membrane protein folding, pHLIP has utility as an agent to target diseased tissues and translocate molecules through the membrane into the cytoplasm of cells in environments with elevated levels of extracellular acidity, as in cancer and inflammation.

  Abstract                 = {Many proteins involved in signal transduction are equipped with covalently attached lipid chains providing a hydrophobic anchor targeting these molecules to membranes. Despite the considerable biological significance of this membrane binding mechanism for 5-10\% of all cellular proteins, to date very little is known about structural and dynamical features of lipidated membrane binding domains. Here we report the first comprehensive study of the molecular dynamics of the C-terminus of membrane-associated full-length lipidated Ras protein determined by solid-state NMR. Fully functional lipid-modified N-Ras protein was obtained by chemical-biological synthesis ligating the expressed water soluble N-terminus with a chemically synthesized (2)H or (13)C labeled lipidated heptapeptide. Dynamical parameters for the lipid chain modification at Cys 181 were determined from static (2)H NMR order parameter and relaxation measurements. Order parameters describing the amplitude of motion in the protein backbone and the side chain were determined from site-specific measurements of (1)H-(13)C dipolar couplings for all seven amino acids in the membrane anchor of Ras. Finally, the correlation times of motion were determined from temperature dependent relaxation time measurements and analyzed using a modified Lipari Szabo approach. Overall, the C-terminus of Ras shows a versatile dynamics with segmental fluctuations and axially symmetric overall motions on the membrane surface. In particular, the lipid chain modifications are highly flexible in the membrane.},

  abstract =    {Membrane protein stability is a key parameter with important physiological and practical implications. Inorganic salts affect protein stability, but the mechanisms of their interactions with membrane proteins are not completely understood. We have undertaken the study of a prototypical G-protein-coupled receptor, the Î±-helical membrane protein rhodopsin from vertebrate retina, and explored the effects of inorganic salts on the thermal decay properties of both its inactive and photoactivated states. Under high salt concentrations, rhodopsin significantly increased its activation enthalpy change for thermal bleaching, whereas acid denaturation affected the formation of a denatured loose-bundle state for both the active and inactive conformations. This behavior seems to correlate with changes in protonated Schiff-base hydrolysis. However, chromophore regeneration with the 11-cis-retinal chromophore and MetarhodopsinII decay kinetics were slower only in the presence of sodium chloride, suggesting that in this case, the underlying phenomenon may be linked to the activation of rhodopsin and the retinal release processes. Furthermore, the melting temperature, determined by means of circular dichroism and differential scanning calorimetry measurements, was increased in the presence of high salt concentrations. The observed effects on rhodopsin could indicate that salts favor electrostatic interactions in the retinal binding pocket and indirectly favor hydrophobic interactions at the membrane protein receptor core. These effects can be exploited in applications where the stability of membrane proteins in solution is highly desirable.},

In most previous studies, these models were validated by comparing calculated atomic fluctuations for isolated proteins with experimental temperature factors determined in the crystalline state, although there were also hints that including crystal contacts in the calculations has an impact on the comparison. In this study, a set of 83 ultra-high resolution crystal structures with experimentally determined anisotropic displacement parameters is used to evaluate several C(alpha)-based elastic network models that either ignore or treat the crystal environment in different ways; the latter include using periodic boundary conditions defined with respect to the asymmetric unit or the primitive unit cell as well as using the Born-von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n boundary condition that accounts for lattice vibrations. For all elastic network models, treating the crystal environment leads to better agreement with experimental anisotropic displacement parameters with the Born-von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n boundary condition giving the best agreement. Atomic correlations over the entire protein are clearly affected by the presence of the crystal contacts and fairly sensitive to the way that the crystal environment is treated. These observations highlight the importance of properly treating the protein system in an environment consistent with experiment when either evaluating approximate protein models or using approximate dynamic models in structural refinement application types. Finally, investigation of the scaling behaviors of the cumulative density of states and the heat capacity indicates that there are still gaps between simplified elastic models and all-atom models for proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {While reliable procedures for determining the conformations of proteins are available, methods for generating ensembles of structures that also reflect their flexibility are much less well established. Here we present a systematic assessment of the ability of ensemble-averaged molecular dynamics simulations with ensemble-averaged NMR restraints to simultaneously reproduce the average structure of proteins and their associated dynamics. We discuss the effects that under-restraining (overfitting) and over-restraining (underfitting) have on the structures generated in ensemble-averaged molecular simulations. We then introduce the MUMO (minimal under-restraining minimal over-restraining) method, a procedure in which different observables are averaged over a different number of molecules. As both over-restraining and under-restraining are significantly reduced in the MUMO method, it is possible to generate ensembles of conformations that accurately characterize both the structure and the dynamics of native states of proteins. The application of the MUMO method to the protein ubiquitin yields a high-resolution structural ensemble with an RDC Q-factor of 0.19.},

The method increases computational speed by eliminating water molecules that either surround the vesicle or reside in the interior of the vesicle, without altering the properties of the water at the membrane interface. Specifically, mean field force approximation (MFFA) boundary potentials are used to replace both the internal and external excess bulk solvent. In addition to reducing the cost of simulating preformed vesicles, the molding effect of the boundary potentials also enhances the formation and equilibration of vesicles from random solutions of lipid in water. Vesicles with diameters in the range from 20 to 60 nm were obtained on a nanosecond time scale, without any noticeable effect of the boundary potentials on their structure.},

  abstract =             {The serotonin, h5-HT 4 receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) known to be involved in a variety of pathological disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome, cardiac atrial arrhythmia and memory deficits. Recent studies have also underlined its potential role in Alzheimer's disease. We present here the results of molecular dynamics simulations of h5-HT 4 receptor binding a non-peptide antagonist ligand in a realistic membrane environment. The GPCR-bound ligand model built in vacuo using homology modelling of bovine rhodopsin and several experimental constraints [L. Rivail, et al., New insights into the human 5-HT 4 receptor binding site: exploration of a hydrophobic pocket, Br. J. Pharmacol. 143(3) (2004) 361Ã¢ÂÂ370] was relaxed during 10ÃÂ ns of constant pressure and constant temperature simulation. The results show that the receptor model is stable and that the key interactions formed with the ligand and identified experimentally are conserved. The simulations further reveal that several water molecules migrate from the extracellular milieu toward the putative hydrophobic pocket [L. Rivail, et al., New insights into the human 5-HT 4 receptor binding site: exploration of a hydrophobic pocket, Br. J. Pharmacol. 143(3) (2004) 361Ã¢ÂÂ370; R.

Des. 11(6) (1997) 589Ã¢ÂÂ599] accommodating the ligand, and form a network of interactions with the receptor, hence underlining the limitations of the in vacuo construct. The refined three-dimensional model of the receptor can now be used for docking studies of other ligands, thereby helping the rational design of new drugs for h5-HT 4 .},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, two biosurfactant-producing strains, Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus licheniformis, have been characterized. Both strains were able to grow at high salinity conditions and produce biosurfactants up to 10\% NaCl. Both extracted-enriched biosurfactants showed good surface tension reduction of water, from 72 to 26-30 mN/m, low critical micelle concentration, and high resistance to pH and salinity. The potential of the two lipopeptide biosurfactants at inhibiting biofilm adhesion of pathogenic bacteria was demonstrated by using the MBEC device. The two biosurfactants showed interesting specific anti-adhesion activity being able to inhibit selectively biofilm formation of two pathogenic strains. In particular, Escherichia coli CFT073 and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 biofilm formation was decreased of 97\% and 90\%, respectively. The V9T14 biosurfactant active on the Gram-negative strain was ineffective against the Gram-positive and the opposite for the V19T21. This activity was observed either by coating the polystyrene surface or by adding the biosurfactant to the inoculum. Two fractions from each purified biosurfactant, obtained by flash chromatography, fractions (I) and (II), showed that fraction (II), belonging to fengycin-like family, was responsible for the anti-adhesion activity against biofilm of both strains.},

Mutation of Lys-296 or Glu-113 results in constitutive activation of opsin, as assayed by its ability to activate transducin in the absence of added chromophore. We conclude that opsin is constrained to an inactive conformation by a salt bridge between Lys-296 and Glu-113.

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a procedure to determine the structures of proteins by incorporating NMR chemical shifts as structural restraints in molecular dynamics simulations. In this approach, the chemical shifts are expressed as differentiable functions of the atomic coordinates and used to compute forces to generate trajectories that lead to the reduction of the differences between experimental and calculated chemical shifts. We show that this strategy enables the folding of a set of proteins with representative topologies starting from partially denatured initial conformations without the use of additional experimental information. This method also enables the straightforward combination of chemical shifts with other standard NMR restraints, including those derived from NOE, J-coupling, and residual dipolar coupling measurements. We illustrate this aspect by calculating the structure of a transiently populated excited state conformation from chemical shift and residual dipolar coupling data measured by relaxation dispersion NMR experiments.},

  abstract    = {We describe a method for rapidly computing the relative affinities of an inhibitor for all individual members of a family of homologous receptors. The approach, implemented in a new program, SCR, models inhibitor-receptor interactions in full atomic detail with an empirical energy function and includes an explicit account of flexibility in homology-modeled receptors through sampling of libraries of side chain rotamers. SCR's general utility was demonstrated by application to seven different protein kinase inhibitors: for each inhibitor, relative binding affinities with panels of approximately 20 protein kinases were computed and compared with experimental data. For five of the inhibitors (SB203580, purvalanol B, imatinib, H89, and hymenialdisine), SCR provided excellent reproduction of the experimental trends and, importantly, was capable of identifying the targets of inhibitors even when they belonged to different kinase families. The method's performance in a predictive setting was demonstrated by performing separate training and testing applications, and its key assumptions were tested by comparison with a number of alternative approaches employing the ligand-docking program AutoDock (Morris et al. J. Comput. Chem. 1998, 19, 1639-1662). These comparison tests included using AutoDock in nondocking and docking modes and performing energy minimizations of inhibitor-kinase complexes with the molecular mechanics code GROMACS (Berendsen et al. Comput. Phys. Commun. 1995, 91, 43-56). It was found that a surprisingly important aspect of SCR's approach is its assumption that the inhibitor be modeled in the same orientation for each kinase: although this assumption is in some respects unrealistic, calculations that used apparently more realistic approaches produced clearly inferior results. Finally, as a large-scale application of the method, SB203580, purvalanol B, and imatinib were screened against an almost full complement of 493 human protein kinases using SCR in order to identify potential new targets; the predicted targets of SB203580 were compared with those identified in recent proteomics-based experiments. These kinome-wide screens, performed within a day on a small cluster of PCs, indicate that explicit computation of inhibitor-receptor binding affinities has the potential to promote rapid discovery of new therapeutic targets for existing inhibitors.},

  Abstract                 = {An optimized technique for calculating the excess chemical potential of small molecules in dense liquids and the binding affinity of molecular ligands to biomolecules is reported. In this method, a molecular species is coupled to the system of interest via a nonphysical fourth spatial dimension w through which insertion or extraction can be carried out [R. Pomes, E. Eisenmesser, C. B. Post et al., J. Chem. Phys. 111, 3387 (1999)]. Molecular simulations are used to compute the potential of mean force (PMF) acting on the solute molecule in the fourth dimension. The excess chemical potential of that molecule is obtained as the difference in the PMF between fully coupled and fully decoupled systems. The simplicity, efficiency, and generality of the method are demonstrated for the calculation of the hydration free energies of water and methanol as well as sodium, cesium, and chloride ions. A significant advantage over other methods is that the 4D-PMF approach provides a single effective and general route for decoupling all nonbonded interactions (i.e., both Lennard-Jones and Coulombic) at once for both neutral and charged solutes. Direct calculation of the mean force from thermodynamic integration is shown to be more computationally efficient than calculating the PMF from umbrella sampling. Statistical error analysis suggests a simple strategy for optimizing sampling. The detailed analysis of systematic errors arising from the truncation of Coulombic interactions in a solvent droplet of finite size leads to straightforward corrections to ionic hydration free energies.},

  Abstract                 = {Distributed replica sampling [T. Rodinger et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2, 725 (2006)] is a simple and general scheme for Boltzmann sampling of conformational space by computer simulation in which multiple replicas of the system undergo a random walk in reaction coordinate or temperature space. Individual replicas are linked through a generalized Hamiltonian containing an extra potential energy term or bias which depends on the distribution of all replicas, thus enforcing the desired sampling distribution along the coordinate or parameter of interest regardless of free energy barriers. In contrast to replica exchange methods, efficient implementation of the algorithm does not require synchronicity of the individual simulations. The algorithm is inherently suited for large-scale simulations using shared or heterogeneous computing platforms such as a distributed network. In this work, we build on our original algorithm by introducing Boltzmann-weighted jumping, which allows moves of a larger magnitude and thus enhances sampling efficiency along the reaction coordinate. The approach is demonstrated using a realistic and biologically relevant application; we calculate the standard binding free energy of benzene to the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme. Distributed replica sampling is used in conjunction with thermodynamic integration to compute the potential of mean force for extracting the ligand from protein and solvent along a nonphysical spatial coordinate. Dynamic treatment of the reaction coordinate leads to faster statistical convergence of the potential of mean force than a conventional static coordinate, which suffers from slow transitions on a rugged potential energy surface.},

  Abstract                 = {Membrane-bound cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenases play a crucial role in bacterial respiration by oxidizing menaquinol and transferring electrons to various periplasmic oxidoreductases. In this work, the menaquinol oxidation site of NrfH was characterized by the determination of the X-ray structure of Desulfovibrio vulgaris NrfHA nitrite reductase complex bound to 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which is shown to act as a competitive inhibitor of NrfH quinol oxidation activity. The structure, at 2.8-A resolution, reveals that the inhibitor binds close to NrfH heme 1, where it establishes polar contacts with two essential residues: Asp89, the residue occupying the heme distal ligand position, and Lys82, a strictly conserved residue. The menaquinol binding cavity is largely polar and has a wide opening to the protein surface. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the quinol binding site of NrfH and several other respiratory enzymes lie in the head group region of the membrane, which probably facilitates proton transfer to the periplasm. Although NrfH is not a multi-span membrane protein, its quinol binding site has several characteristics similar to those of quinone binding sites previously described. The data presented here provide the first characterization of the quinol binding site of the cytochrome c quinol dehydrogenase family.},

Simulated melting curves show different profiles for the C and N-terminal hairpins, consistent with differences in secondary structure content in published NMR and CD/FTIR measurements, which probed different regions of the chain. Individual beta-hairpins that comprise the three-stranded beta-sheet are observed to form cooperatively. Partial folding cooperativity between the component hairpins is observed, and good agreement between calculated and experimental values quantifying this cooperativity is obtained when similar analysis techniques are used. However, the structural detail in the ensemble of conformations sampled in the simulations permits a more direct analysis of this cooperativity than has been performed on the basis of experimental data.

Previously, the occurrence of lipopeptide antibiotics fengycin, iturin/bacillomycin and surfactin in the extracts was verified by diverse chromatographic approaches. Conidial germination was strongly reduced by antifungal extracts obtained from liquid cultures of both B. subtilis strains. Scanning electron microscopy analysis showed morphological damage in conidia characterized by the presence of large depressions and loss of turgidness. Transmission electron microscopy analysis revealed severe modifications in the plasma membrane and disorganization of the P. fusca cell cytoplasm.The lipopeptides produced by the two strains of B. subtilis are able to reduce cucurbit powdery mildew disease by arresting conidial germination, which seems to result from the induction of important cytological alterations.We elucidated the mechanisms employed by these antagonistic strains of B. subtilis to suppress cucurbit powdery mildew disease and delineate the ultrastructural damages responsible for their suppressive effect.},

  Abstract                 = {Podosphaera fusca is the main causal agent of cucurbit powdery mildew in Spain. Four Bacillus subtilis strains, UMAF6614, UMAF6619, UMAF6639, and UMAF8561, with proven ability to suppress the disease on melon in detached leaf and seedling assays, were subjected to further analyses to elucidate the mode of action involved in their biocontrol performance. Cell-free supernatants showed antifungal activities very close to those previously reported for vegetative cells. Identification of three lipopeptide antibiotics, surfactin, fengycin, and iturin A or bacillomycin, in butanolic extracts from cell-free culture filtrates of these B. subtilis strains pointed out that antibiosis could be a major factor involved in their biocontrol ability. The strong inhibitory effect of purified lipopeptide fractions corresponding to bacillomycin, fengycin, and iturin A on P. fusca conidia germination, as well as the in situ detection of these lipopeptides in bacterial-treated melon leaves, provided interesting evidence of their putative involvement in the antagonistic activity. Those results were definitively supported by site-directed mutagenesis analysis, targeted to suppress the biosynthesis of the different lipopeptides. Taken together, our data have allowed us to conclude that the iturin and fengycin families of lipopeptides have a major role in the antagonism of B. subtilis toward P. fusca.},

  Abstract                 = {One approach to the growing health problem of antibiotic resistant bacteria is the development of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as alternative treatments. The mechanism by which these AMPs selectively attack the bacterial membrane is not well understood, but is believed to depend on differences in membrane lipid composition. N-acylation of the small amidated hexapeptide, RRWQWR-NH(2) (LfB6), derived from the 25 amino acid bovine lactoferricin (LfB25) can be an effective means to improve its antimicrobial properties. Here, we investigate the interactions of C6-LfB6, N-acylated with a 6 carbon fatty acid, with model lipid bilayers with two distinct compositions: 3:1 POPE:POPG (negatively charged) and POPC (zwitterionic). Results from solid-state (2)H and (31)P NMR experiments are compared with those from an ensemble of all-atom molecular dynamic simulations running in aggregate more than 8.6ms. (2)H NMR spectra reveal no change in the lipid acyl chain order when C6-LfB6 is bound to the negatively charged membrane and only a slight decrease in order when it is bound to the zwitterionic membrane. (31)P NMR spectra show no significant perturbation of the phosphate head groups of either lipid system in the presence of C6-LfB6. Molecular dynamic simulations show that for the negatively charged membrane, the peptide's arginines drive the initial association with the membrane, followed by attachment of the tryptophans at the membrane-water interface, and finally by the insertion of the C6 tails deep into the bilayer. In contrast, the C6 tail leads the association with the zwitterionic membrane, with the tryptophans and arginines associating with the membrane-water interface in roughly the same amount of time. We find similar patterns in the order parameters from our simulations. Moreover, we find in the simulations that the C6 tail can insert 1-2Ã more deeply into the zwitterionic membrane and can exist in a wider range of angles than in the negatively charged membrane. We propose this is due to the larger area per lipid in the zwitterionic membrane, which provides more space for the C6 to insert and assume different orientations.},

In contrast to all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, the low computational investment required to use an ENM makes them ideal for speculative hypothesis-testing situations. Historically, ENMs have been validated via comparison to crystallographic B-factors, but this comparison is relatively low-resolution and only tests the predictions of relative flexibility. In this work, we systematically validate and optimize a number of ENM-type models by quantitatively comparing their predictions to microsecond-scale all-atom simulations of three different G protein coupled receptors. We show that, despite their apparent simplicity, well-optimized ENMs perform remarkably well, reproducing the protein fluctuations with an accuracy comparable to what one would expect from all-atom simulations run for several hundred nanoseconds.},

Here, we characterize a 1.02 mus all-atom simulation of an apo-beta(2) adrenergic receptor that is missing the third intracellular loop to better understand the inactive structure. Although we find that the structure is remarkably rigid, there is a rapid influx of water into the core of the protein, as well as a slight expansion of the molecule relative to the crystal structure. In contrast to the x-ray crystal structures, the ionic lock rapidly reforms, although we see an activation-precursor-like event wherein the ionic lock opens for approximately 200 ns, accompanied by movements in the transmembrane helices associated with activation. When the lock reforms, we see the structure return to its inactive conformation. We also find that the ionic lock exists in three states: closed (or locked), semi-open with a bridging water molecule, and open. The interconversion of these states involves the concerted motion of the entire protein. We characterize these states and the concerted motion underlying their interconversion. These findings may help elucidate the connection between key local events and the associated global structural changes during activation.},

To overcome the structural flexibility of the beta2AR and to facilitate its crystallization, we engineered a beta2AR fusion protein in which T4 lysozyme (T4L) replaces most of the third intracellular loop of the GPCR ("beta2AR-T4L") and showed that this protein retains near-native pharmacologic properties. Analysis of adrenergic receptor ligand-binding mutants within the context of the reported high-resolution structure of beta2AR-T4L provides insights into inverse-agonist binding and the structural changes required to accommodate catecholamine agonists. Amino acids known to regulate receptor function are linked through packing interactions and a network of hydrogen bonds, suggesting a conformational pathway from the ligand-binding pocket to regions that interact with G proteins.},

  Abstract                 = {The interaction between host-defense antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) governs both the susceptibility of the bacteria to the peptide and the ability of the peptide to inhibit LPS activation of immune cells. Both functions depend on the biophysical properties of the peptides. However, the sequence and structural diversity of AMPs makes it difficult to determine common denominators required for antimicrobial and LPS neutralizing activities. Toward this end, we synthesized and investigated a series of nine 12-amino acid peptides and their fatty acid-conjugated analogues composed of both D- and L-isomers of Leu and Lys at various ratios. The positions of the D-amino acids were preserved. These peptides differ in their net positive charge and hydrophobicity. However, their overall structure in the membrane is similar, as determined by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The peptides and their analogues were functionally tested for their antibacterial and hemolytic activity, their ability to permeate LPS vesicles, their ability to neutralize LPS activation of macrophages, and their effect on LPS morphology, determined by negative staining electron microscopy. The data revealed that increasing the ratio between hydrophobicity and the net positive charge increases both antimicrobial and LPS neutralization activities, but with different modes of contributions. Whereas antimicrobial activity increases linearly with the increase in the peptides' hydrophobicity, peptides with different hydrophobicities are endowed with similar LPS neutralizing activities. Besides adding important information regarding AMP parameters involved in antimicrobial and anti-LPS activities, this study suggests the use of such diastereomers as potential templates for the development of simple molecules that conduct both types of functions.},

The ability of host-defense antimicrobial peptides to bind LPS on intact bacteria and in suspension has been implicated in their antimicrobial and LPS detoxification activities. However, the mechanisms involved and the properties of the peptides that enable them to traverse the LPS barrier or to neutralize LPS endotoxic activity are not yet fully understood. Here we investigated a series of antimicrobial peptides and their analogues with drastically altered sequences and structures, all of which share the same amino acid composition (K6L9). The list includes both all-L-amino acid peptides and their diastereomers (composed of both L- and D-amino acids). The peptides were investigated functionally for their antibacterial activity and their ability to block LPS-dependent TNF-ÃÂ± secretion by macrophages. Fluorescence spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy were used to detect their ability to bind LPS and to affect its oligomeric state. Their secondary structure was characterized in solution, in LPS suspension, and in LPS multibilayers by using CD and FTIR spectroscopy. Our data reveal specific biophysical properties of the peptides that are required to kill bacteria and/or to detoxify LPS. Besides shedding light on the mechanisms of these two important functions, the information gathered should assist in the development of AMPs with potent antimicrobial and LPS detoxification activities.},

  abstract             = {A theoretical framework is elaborated to account for the effect of a transmembrane potential in computer dynamics simulations. It is shown that a simulation with a constant external electric field applied in the direction normal to the membrane is equivalent to the influence of surrounding infinite baths maintained to voltage difference via ion-exchanging electrodes connected to an electromotive force (EMF). It is also shown that the linearly-weighted displacement charge within the simulation system tracks the net flow of charge through the external circuit comprising the EMF and the electrodes. Using a statistical mechanical reduction of the degrees of freedom of the external system, three distinct theoretical routes are formulated and examined for the purpose of characterizing the free energy of a protein embedded in a membrane that is submitted to a voltage difference. The W-route is constructed from the variations in the voltage-dependent potential of mean force (PMF) along a reaction path connecting two conformations of the protein. The Q-route is based on the average displacement charge as a function of the conformation of the protein. Finally, the G-route considers the relative charging free energy of specific residues, with and without applied membrane potentials. The theoretical formulation is illustrated with a simple model of an ion crossing a vacuum slab surrounding by two aqueous bulk phases and with a fragment of the voltage-sensor of the KvAP potassium channel.},

  Abstract                 = {The goal of this review is to establish a broad and rigorous theoretical framework to describe ion permeation through biological channels. This framework is developed in the context of atomic models on the basis of the statistical mechanical projection-operator formalism of Mori and Zwanzig. The review is divided into two main parts. The first part introduces the fundamental concepts needed to construct a hierarchy of dynamical models at different level of approximation. In particular, the potential of mean force (PMF) as a configuration-dependent free energy is introduced, and its significance concerning equilibrium and non-equilibrium phenomena is discussed. In addition, fundamental aspects of membrane electrostatics, with a particular emphasis on the influence of the transmembrane potential, as well as important computational techniques for extracting essential information from all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are described and discussed. The first part of the review provides a theoretical formalism to 'translate' the information from the atomic structure into the familiar language of phenomenological models of ion permeation. The second part is aimed at reviewing and contrasting results obtained in recent computational studies of three very different channels: the gramicidin A (gA) channel, which is a narrow one-ion pore (at moderate concentration), the KcsA channel from Streptomyces lividans, which is a narrow multi-ion pore, and the outer membrane matrix porin F (OmpF) from Escherichia coli, which is a trimer of three beta-barrel subunits each forming wide aqueous multi-ion pores. Comparison with experiments demonstrates that current computational models are approaching semi-quantitative accuracy and are able to provide significant insight into the microscopic mechanisms of ion conduction and selectivity. We conclude that all-atom MD with explicit water molecules can represent important structural features of complex biological channels accurately, including such features as the location of ion-binding sites along the permeation pathway. We finally discuss the broader issue of the validity of ion permeation models and an outlook to the future.},

A cylindrical system is used that is based on a detailed atomic model of the gramicidin dimer, which is solvated at both ends of the channel and surrounded by a simplified model membrane. The entire system consists of 967 atoms and is treated with cylindrical periodic boundary conditions. The gramicidin channel was modeled from the right- handed head-to-head beta-helix dimer determined experimentally by two-dimensional NMR. Simulations were made to estimate the free energy profile in three regions: the transition from bulk- like solvation to single file, the single-file region at the entrance of the channel, and the intermonomer junction of the dimer channel. In each region, approximate corrections are introduced to account for hysteresis effects in the simulations. Binding sites are found at the extremities of the channel in agreement with experiment. The principal energy barrier is at the entrance of the channel in the single-rile region. No large activation energy barrier is introduced by the dehydration process, because the transformation from bulk to single-file solvation is progressive and takes place over a distance of 5-6 angstrom. The free energy simulation results obtained in this paper are joined with those calculated from a periodic model of the interior of the pore to construct an approximate free energy profile of the entire channel system.},

  Abstract                 = {An issue of general interest in computer simulations is to incorporate information from experiments into a structural model. An important caveat in pursuing this goal is to avoid corrupting the resulting model with spurious and arbitrary biases. While the problem of biasing thermodynamic ensembles can be formulated rigorously using the maximum entropy method introduced by Jaynes, the approach can be cumbersome in practical applications with the need to determine multiple unknown coefficients iteratively. A popular alternative strategy to incorporate the information from experiments is to rely on restrained-ensemble molecular dynamics simulations. However, the fundamental validity of this computational strategy remains in question. Here, it is demonstrated that the statistical distribution produced by restrained-ensemble simulations is formally consistent with the maximum entropy method of Jaynes. This clarifies the underlying conditions under which restrained-ensemble simulations will yield results that are consistent with the maximum entropy method.},

  abstract    = {Cholesterol is often found distributed nonrandomly in domains in biological and model membranes and has been reported to be distributed heterogeneously among various intracellular membranes. Although a large body of literature exists on the organization of cholesterol in plasma membranes or membranes with high cholesterol content, very little is known about organization of cholesterol in membranes containing low amounts of cholesterol. Using a fluorescent cholesterol analog (25-[N-[(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-methyl]amino]-27-norcholesterol, or NBD-cholesterol), we have previously shown that cholesterol may exhibit local organization even at very low concentrations in membranes, which could possibly be attributable to transbilayer tail-to-tail dimers. This is supported by similar observations reported by other groups using cholesterol or dehydroergosterol, a naturally occurring fluorescent cholesterol analog which closely mimics cholesterol. In this paper, we have tested the basic features of cholesterol organization in membranes at low concentrations using spectral features of dehydroergosterol. More importantly, we have investigated the role of membrane surface curvature and thickness on transbilayer dimer arrangement of cholesterol using NBD-cholesterol. We find that dimerization is not favored in membranes with high curvature. However, cholesterol dimers are observed again if the curvature stress is relieved. Further, we have monitored the effect of membrane thickness on the dimerization process. Our results show that the dimerization process is stringently controlled by a narrow window of membrane thickness. Interestingly, this type of local organization of NBD-cholesterol at low concentrations is also observed in sphingomyelin-containing membranes. These results could be significant in membranes that have very low cholesterol content, such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the inner mitochondrial membrane, and in trafficking and sorting of cellular cholesterol.},

  abstract    = {Sterol 14alpha-demethylase (CYP51) is one of the known major targets for azole antifungals. Therapeutic side effects of these antifungals are based on interactions of the azoles with the human analogue enzyme. This study describes for the first time a comparison of a human CYP51 (HU-CYP51) homology model with a homology model of the fungal CYP51 of Candida albicans (CA-CYP51). Both models are constructed by using the crystal structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis MT-CYP51 (PDB code: 1EA1). The binding mode of the azole ketoconazole is investigated in molecular dynamics simulations with the GROMACS force field. The usage of special parameters for the iron azole complex binding is necessary to obtain the correct complex geometry in the active site of the enzyme models. Based on the dynamics simulations it is possible to explain the enantioselectivity of the human enzyme and also to predict the binding mode of the isomers of ketoconazole in the active site of the fungal model.},

The structure of HA in complex with a known inhibitor of membrane fusion and virus infectivity, tert-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ), shows that the inhibitor binds in a hydrophobic pocket formed at an interface between HA monomers. Occupation of this site by TBHQ stabilizes the neutral pH structure through intersubunit and intrasubunit interactions that presumably inhibit the conformational rearrangements required for membrane fusion. The nature of the binding site suggests routes for the chemical modification of TBHQ that could lead to the development of more potent inhibitors of membrane fusion and potential anti-influenza drugs.},

Comparison is made with the isotope effect upon the viscosity, and some subtle differences are outlined. The most substantial one is related to the isotope effects upon Cs-133+ and Cl-35- relaxation which selectively probe motions in the first cosphere of the ions. These are substantially lower than those observed with the other dynamical quantities, showing that dynamical isotope effects in the first cosphere may differ substantially from those in the bulk. It is concluded that the structure-breaking effect extends to the first co-sphere of the ions.},

The study shows that current computational resources are powerful enough to generate a truly electrified interface, as we show the predicted effect of the field on the overall charge distribution. Additionally, starting from Poisson's equation, we show a new derivation of the double integral equation for calculating the potential profile in systems with this type of periodicity.},

The local influence of the ions, however, has been unknown due to limited structural resolution of experimental methods. Molecular dynamics simulations are used here to elucidate local structural rearrangements upon association of a series of monovalent Na+ salts to a palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine bilayer. We observe association of all ion types in the interfacial region. Larger anions, which are meant to rationalize data regarding a Hofmeister series of anions, bind more deeply within the bilayer than either Cl- or Na+. Although the simulations are able to reproduce experimentally measured quantities, the analysis is focused on local properties currently invisible to experiments, which may be critical to biological systems. As such, for all ion types, including Cl-, we show local ion-induced perturbations to headgroup tilt, the extent and direction of which is sensitive to ion charge and size. Additionally, we report salt-induced ordering of the water well beyond the interfacial region, which may be significant in terms of hydration repulsion between stacked bilayers.}

  Abstract                 = {Reconstruction and interpretation of lipid bilayer structure from X-ray scattering often rely on assumptions regarding the molecular distributions across the bilayer. It is usually assumed that changes in head-head spacings across the bilayer, as measured from electron density profiles, equal the variations in hydrocarbon thicknesses. One can then determine the structure of a bilayer by comparison to the known structure of a lipid with the same headgroup. Here we examine this procedure using simulated electron density profiles for the benchmark lipids DMPC and DPPC. We compare simulation and experiment in both real and Fourier space to address two main aspects: (i) the measurement of head-head spacings from relative electron density profiles, and (ii) the determination of the absolute scale for these profiles. We find supporting evidence for the experimental procedure, thus explaining the robustness and consistency of experimental structural results derived from electron density profiles. However, we also expose potential pitfalls in the Fourier reconstruction that are due to the limited number of scattering peaks. Volumetric analysis of simulated bilayers allows us to propose an improved, yet simple method for scale determination. In this way we are able to remove some of the restrictions imposed by limited scattering data in constructing reliable electron density profiles. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}

  Abstract                 = {To model a concentration gradient across a biomembrane, we have performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of NaCl solutions separated by two oppositely charged plates. We have employed the recently formulated three-dimensional Ewald summation with correction (EW3DC) technique for calculations of long-range electrostatics in two-dimensionally periodic systems, allowing for different salt concentrations on the two sides of the plates. Six simulations were run, varying the salt concentrations and plate surface charge density in a biologically relevant range. The simulations reveal well-defined, atomic-level asymmetries between the two sides: distinct translational and rotational orderings of water molecules; differing ion residency times; a clear wetting layer adjacent only to the negative plate; and marked differences in charge density/potential profiles which reflect the microscopic behavior. These phenomena, which may play important roles in membrane and ion channel physiology, result primarily from the electrostatics and asymmetry of water molecules, and not from the salt ions. In order to establish that EW3DC can accurately capture fundamental electrostatic interactions important to asymmetric biomembrane systems, the CHARMM force-field (with the corrected Ewald sum) has been used. Comparison of the results with previously published simulations of electrolyte near charged surfaces, which employed different force-fields, shows the robustness of the CHARMM potential and gives confidence in future all-atom bilayer simulations using EW3DC and CHARMM.

In the gas phase the interpretation has been done in the context of the HSAB principle using Gazquez's formalism using the polarizability (proportional to softness) of the two minima corresponding to the two ion-molecule complexes, and the TS, the softness of the nucleophile and the charge on the leaving group. The thermodynamic study shows that the reaction energy, DeltaE(r-p) and the energy differences between the two ion- molecule complexes, DeltaE(m), are close to the experimental data available. The application of the MHP indicates that in these reactions the molecules arrange themselves to be as hard as possible. The polarizable continuum model (PCM) has been used to study the influence of the solvent on the kinetics of the S(N)2 reaction. The application of Gazquez's formula provides fundamental information in a case study, with X = Cl and Y = I: the activation energy calculated with the PCM model yields a very good correlation with the values obtained with Gazquez's formula. Finally, we concentrate on the influence of solvation on the nucleophilicity and the kinetics using the (PCM) model with X = F, I and Y = Br and compare the results with the gas phase. The order of reactivity in the gas phase is F- < I-, which is the same order as in the solvent using the polarizable continuum model, but opposed to experiment. If, however, we take into consideration the interaction energy caused by the hydrogen bond, the order of reactivity in solution is reversed yielding the same results as experiment.},

Fluorocarbon chains typically have an all-trans conformation, showing a highly ordered structure in the membrane core compared to ordinary hydrocarbon chains. The free energy profiles of water across the bilayers were successfully estimated by a revised cavity insertion Widom method. The fluorinated bilayer showed a higher free energy barrier than an ordinary nonfluorinated lipid bilayer by about 1.2 kcal/mol, suggesting a lower water permeability of the fluorinated bilayer membrane. A cavity distribution analysis elucidated the reduced free volume in the fluorinated membrane due to the neatly packed chains, which should account for the higher free energy barrier.},

The system is analyzed by performing a molecular dynamics simulation study at ambient conditions in the fluid lamellar phase. By separately calculating the different partial contributions to the total order parameter profiles measurable experimentally, we are able to get insights into the molecular origin of earlier experimental and theoretical observations. The effect of the position of the different conformations of double-bond segments along the polyunsaturated acyl chain is also examined. As in experiments performed in a series of lipid bilayers with an increasing number of cis double bonds per lipid molecule [Holte, L. L., et al. Biophys. J. 1995, 68, 2396], we find that unsaturations influence mainly the order of the bottom half of the saturated chain. Specific conformations of the polyunsaturated chain close to the lipid headgroups have a distinct effect on the order of the bottom half of the saturated chain and on the top half of the polyunsaturated chain. Our results indicate that for SDPC the conformation of the region of the polyunsaturated chain located between the first three cis double bonds is responsible for the major effects on the orientational order of both the saturated and the polyunsaturated chains.},

The model membrane, a 1-stearoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (SDPC, 18:0/22:6 PC) lipid bilayer, was investigated at constant (room) temperature and (ambient) pressure, and the results obtained in the nanosecond time scale reproduced quite well the available experimental data. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are found in high concentrations in neuronal and retinal tissues and are essential for the development of human brain function. The docosahexaenoic fatty acid, in particular, is fundamental for the proper function of the visual receptor rhodopsin. The lipid bilayer order has been investigated through the orientational order parameters. The water-lipid interface has been explored thoroughly in terms of its dimensions and the organization of the different components. Several types of interactions occurring in the system have been analyzed, specifically, the water-hydrocarbon chain, lipid-lipid and lipid-water interactions. The distribution of dihedral angles along the chains and the molecular conformations of the polyunsaturated chain of the lipids have also been studied. Special attention has been focused on the microscopic (molecular) origin of the effects of polyunsaturations on the different physical properties of membranes.},

  Abstract                 = {The recent report of the crystal structure of rhodopsin provides insights concerning structure-activity relationships in visual pigments and related G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The seven transmembrane helices of rhodopsin are interrupted or kinked at multiple sites. An extensive network of interhelical interactions stabilizes the ground state of the receptor. The ligand-binding pocket of rhodopsin is remarkably compact, and several chromophore-protein interactions were not predicted from mutagenesis or spectroscopic studies. The helix movement model of receptor activation, which likely applies to all GPCRs of the rhodopsin family, is supported by several structural elements that suggest how light-induced conformational changes in the ligand-binding pocket are transmitted to the cytoplasmic surface. The cytoplasmic domain of the receptor includes a helical domain extending from the seventh transmembrane segment parallel to the bilayer surface. The cytoplasmic surface appears to be approximately large enough to bind to the transducin heterotrimer in a one-to-one complex. The structural basis for several unique biophysical properties of rhodopsin, including its extremely low dark noise level and high quantum efficiency, can now be addressed using a combination of structural biology and various spectroscopic methods. Future high-resolution structural studies of rhodopsin and other GPCRs will form the basis to elucidate the detailed molecular mechanism of GPCR-mediated signal transduction.},

  Abstract                 = {The conformation of retinal bound to the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin is intimately linked to its photochemistry, which initiates the visual process. Site-directed deuterium ((2)H) NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate the structure of retinal within the binding pocket of bovine rhodopsin. Aligned recombinant membranes were studied containing rhodopsin that was regenerated with retinal (2)H-labeled at the C(5), C(9), or C(13) methyl groups by total synthesis. Studies were conducted at temperatures below the gel to liquid-crystalline phase transition of the membrane lipid bilayer, where rotational and translational diffusion of rhodopsin is effectively quenched. The experimental tilt series of (2)H NMR spectra were fit to a theoretical line shape analysis [Nevzorov, A. A., Moltke, S., Heyn, M. P., and Brown, M. F. (1999) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 121, 7636-7643] giving the retinylidene bond orientations with respect to the membrane normal in the dark state. Moreover, the relative orientations of pairs of methyl groups were used to calculate effective torsional angles between different planes of unsaturation of the retinal chromophore. Our results are consistent with significant conformational distortion of retinal, and they have important implications for quantum mechanical calculations of its electronic spectral properties. In particular, we find that the beta-ionone ring has a twisted 6-s-cis conformation, whereas the polyene chain is twisted 12-s-trans. The conformational strain of retinal as revealed by solid-state (2)H NMR is significant for explaining the quantum yields and mechanism of its ultrafast photoisomerization in visual pigments. This work provides a consensus view of the retinal conformation in rhodopsin as seen by X-ray diffraction, solid-state NMR spectroscopy, and quantum chemical calculations.},

  abstract    = {The structural and photochemical changes in rhodopsin due to absorption of light are crucial for understanding the process of visual signaling. We investigated the structure of trans-retinal in the metarhodopsin I photointermediate (MI), where the retinylidene cofactor functions as an antagonist. Rhodopsin was regenerated using retinal that was (2)H-labeled at the C5, C9, or C13 methyl groups and was reconstituted with 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine. Membranes were aligned by isopotential centrifugation, and rhodopsin in the supported bilayers was then bleached and cryotrapped in the MI state. Solid-state (2)H NMR spectra of oriented rhodopsin in the low-temperature lipid gel state were analyzed in terms of a static uniaxial distribution (Nevzorov, A. A.; Moltke, S.; Heyn, M. P.; Brown, M. F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999, 121, 7636-7643). The line shape analysis allowed us to obtain the methyl bond orientations relative to the membrane normal in the presence of substantial alignment disorder (mosaic spread). Relative orientations of the methyl groups were used to calculate effective torsional angles between the three different planes that represent the polyene chain and the beta-ionone ring of retinal. Assuming a three-plane model, a less distorted structure was found for retinal in MI compared to the dark state. Our results are pertinent to how photonic energy is channeled within the protein to allow the strained retinal conformation to relax, thereby forming the activated state of the receptor.},

Here we show data obtained from POPC, POPE and mixed POPE/POPG bilayers, representative of bacterial membranes, in the presence of cholesterol or ergosterol and antimicrobial peptaibols. Whereas sterols have a strong ordering effect also on these membranes, the peptides exhibit neutral or disordering effects. By comparing with data from the literature it becomes obvious that cationic amphipathic peptides that probably reside within the interface of phospholipid membranes tend to strongly disorder the packing of the fatty acyl chains, an effect that has been correlated to antimicrobial and DNA transfection activities. In contrast transmembrane sequences or hydrophobic peptides that probably partition deeply into the membrane tend to have only modest disordering activities. The (2)H solid-state NMR approach has also been used to monitor the lateral separation of domains rich in anionic phospholipids in the presence of cationic peptides and has thereby provided important insights into their mechanisms of action.},

In this work we report the crystal structures of both ground state and a photoactivated deprotonated intermediate of bovine rhodopsin at a resolution of 4.15 A. In the photoactivated state, the Schiff base linking the chromophore and Lys-296 becomes deprotonated, reminiscent of the G protein-activating state, metarhodopsin II. The structures reveal that the changes that accompany photoactivation are smaller than previously predicted for the metarhodopsin II state and include changes on the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin that possibly enable the coupling to its cognate G protein, transducin. Furthermore, rhodopsin forms a potentially physiologically relevant dimer interface that involves helices I, II, and 8, and when taken with the prior work that implicates helices IV and V as the physiological dimer interface may account for one of the interfaces of the oligomeric structure of rhodopsin seen in the membrane by atomic force microscopy. The activation and oligomerization models likely extend to the majority of other G protein-coupled receptors.},

Agonist ligands bind their cognate GPCRs stabilizing the active conformation that is competent to bind G proteins, thus initiating a cascade of intracellular signaling events leading to modification of the cell activity. Despite their biomedical importance, the only known GPCR crystal structures are those of inactive rhodopsin forms. In order to understand how GPCRs are able to transduce extracellular signals across the plasma membrane, it is critical to determine the structure of these receptors in their ligand-bound, active state. Here, we report a novel combination of purification procedures that allowed the crystallization of rhodopsin in two new crystal forms and can be applicable to the purification and crystallization of other membrane proteins. Importantly, these new crystals are stable upon photoactivation and the preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of both photoactivated and ground state rhodopsin crystals are also reported.},

  abstract    = {We investigated both the structural and functional consequences of modifying the hydrophobic, lipopeptide-mimetic oligo-acyl-lysine (OAK) N(alpha)-hexadecanoyl-l-lysyl-l-lysyl-aminododecanoyl-l-lysyl-amide (c(16)KKc(12)K) to its unsaturated analog hexadecenoyl-KKc(12)K [c(16(omega7))KKc(12)K]. Despite similar tendencies for self-assembly in solution (critical aggregation concentrations, approximately 10 muM), the analogous OAKs displayed dissimilar antibacterial properties (e.g., bactericidal kinetics taking minutes versus hours). Diverse experimental evidence provided insight into these discrepancies: whereas c(16(omega7))KKc(12)K created wiry interconnected nanofiber networks, c(16)KKc(12)K formed both wider and stiffer fibers which displayed distinct binding properties to phospholipid membranes. Unsaturation also shifted their gel-to-liquid transition temperatures and altered their light-scattering properties, suggesting the disassembly of c(16(omega7))KKc(12)K in the presence of bacteria. Collectively, the data indicated that the higher efficiency in interfering with bacterial viability emanated from a wobbly packing imposed by a single double bond. This suggests that similar strategies might improve hydrophobic OAKs and related lipopeptide antibiotics.},

  Abstract                 = {Bovine rhodopsin contains 11-cis-retinal as a light-absorbing chromophore that binds to a lysine residue of the apoprotein opsin via a protonated Schiff base linkage. Light isomerizes 11-cis-retinal into the all-trans form, which eventually leads to the formation of an enzymatically active state, metarhodopsin II (MII). It is widely believed that MII forms a pH-dependent equilibrium with metarhodopsin I (MI), but direct evidence for this equilibrium has not been reported. Here, we confirmed this equilibrium by direct observation of the mutual conversions of MI and MII upon changing the pH of the MI/MII mixture. We also observed a reversible binding of the synthetic peptide constituting the C-terminal 11 amino acids of the transducin alpha-subunit to MII, which resulted in change of the amounts of MI and MII in the equilibrium. Interestingly, addition of the peptide did not induce a simple pK(a) shift but rather induced an increase of the MII fraction at high pH. These results indicate that in addition to the MII that is formed from MI in a pH-dependent manner there also exists another MII, which is in equilibrium with MI in a pH-independent manner and can bind to the peptide. Therefore, there is no need for proton uptake by the protein moiety of opsin for the binding to the peptide.},

  annotation = {In the testing of the theory of dissociative electron transfer with experimental data pertaining to the electrochemical and homogeneous reduction of alkyl halides, uncertainties arising from the estimation of the effect of solvent dynamics and reorganisation as well as of the resonance energy in the transition state are minimized by a comparative strategy which utilizes information derived from outer-sphere electron- transfer data gathered in the same solvent. Application of this strategy leads to a good agreement between theory and experiment in the electrochemical case. In the homogeneous case, the agreement is equally satisfactory in the case of tertiary halides. With the less sterically hindered secondary and primary halides, the reaction possesses an S(N)2 character involving small bonded interactions in the transition state in accord with previous stereochemical results and reaction entropy determinations.},

  Abstract                 = {Delta-opioid (DOP) receptors are members of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) sub-family of opioid receptors, and are evolutionarily related, with homology exceeding 70\%, to cognate mu-opioid (MOP), kappa-opioid (KOP), and nociceptin opioid (NOP) receptors. DOP receptors are considered attractive drug targets for pain management because agonists at these receptors are reported to exhibit strong antinociceptive activity with relatively few side effects. Among the most potent analgesics targeting the DOP receptor are the linear and cyclic enkephalin analogs known as DADLE (Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-Phe-D-Leu) and DPDPE (Tyr-D-Pen-Gly-Phe-D-Pen), respectively. Several computational and experimental studies have been carried out over the years to characterize the conformational profile of these penta-peptides with the ultimate goal of designing potent peptidomimetic agonists for the DOP receptor. The computational studies published to date, however, have investigated only a limited range of timescales and used over-simplified representations of the solvent environment. We provide here a thorough exploration of the conformational space of DADLE and DPDPE in an explicit solvent, using microsecond-scale molecular dynamics and bias-exchange metadynamics simulations. Free-energy profiles derived from these simulations point to a small number of DADLE and DPDPE conformational minima in solution, which are separated by relatively small energy barriers. Candidate bioactive forms of these peptides are selected from identified common spatial arrangements of key pharmacophoric points within all sampled conformations.},

  abstract    = {New methods in treatment of hormone-dependent diseases like prostate or breast cancer have become a major subject in medical and pharmaceutical research. Because of the direct correlation of cancer growth and hormone concentration inhibition of hormone biosynthesis reveals a promising strategy in cancer therapy. The key enzyme of androgen biosynthesis is the cytochrome P450 system 17 alpha-hydroxylase-17,20-lyase. To gain deeper insights into the structure and function of this enzyme, whose crystal structure is still unknown we present in this paper a theoretical 3D-model of the human 17 alpha-hydroxylase-17,20-lyase. The model was built by homology modelling using the crystal structure of the P450 CYPeryF as a template. After energy minimisation followed by molecular dynamics simulation the refined model exhibits reasonable protein geometry and a good protein folding quality. For evaluation of protein stability the structure was subjected to molecular dynamics in a waterbox under almost physiological conditions using the GROMACS program. The protein structure and folding remains stable even after 300 ps of free molecular dynamics simulation. The calculation of interaction fields employing the program GRID was used to characterise the active site of the protein. Subsequent docking studies with the natural substrate pregnenolone and further molecular dynamics of the protein-substrate-complexes enabled us to propose a putative binding-site for the physiological substrates.},

  Abstract                 = {Extracellular signals prompt G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to adopt an active conformation (R*) and catalyze GDP/GTP exchange in the alpha-subunit of intracellular G proteins (Galphabetagamma). Kinetic analysis of transducin (G(t)alphabetagamma) activation shows that an intermediary R*xG(t)alphabetagamma.GDP complex is formed that precedes GDP release and formation of the nucleotide-free R*xG protein complex. Based on this reaction sequence, we explore the dynamic interface between the proteins during formation of these complexes. We start from the R* conformation stabilized by a G(t)alpha C-terminal peptide (GalphaCT) obtained from crystal structures of the GPCR opsin. Molecular modeling allows reconstruction of the fully elongated C-terminal alpha-helix of G(t)alpha (alpha5) and shows how alpha5 can be docked to the open binding site of R*. Two modes of interaction are found. One of them--termed stable or S-interaction--matches the position of the GalphaCT peptide in the crystal structure and reproduces the hydrogen-bonding networks between the C-terminal reverse turn of GalphaCT and conserved E(D)RY and NPxxY(x)(5,6)F regions of the GPCR. The alternative fit--termed intermediary or I-interaction--is distinguished by a tilt (42 degrees ) and rotation (90 degrees ) of alpha5 relative to the S-interaction and shows different alpha5 contacts with the NPxxY(x)(5,6)F region and the second cytoplasmic loop of R*. From the 2 alpha5 interactions, we derive a "helix switch" mechanism for the transition of R*xG(t)alphabetagamma.GDP to the nucleotide-free R*xG protein complex that illustrates how alpha5 might act as a transmission rod to propagate the conformational change from the receptor-G protein interface to the nucleotide binding site.},

The nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src is equipped with an N-terminal myristoyl chain and a cluster of basic amino acids for the stable membrane association of the protein. We used 2H NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structure and dynamics of the myristoyl chain of myr-Src(219), and compare them with the hydrocarbon chains of the surrounding phospholipids in bilayers of varying surface potentials and chain lengths. The myristoyl chain of Src was well inserted in all bilayers investigated. In zwitterionic 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine membranes, the myristoyl chain of Src was significantly longer and appears stiffer than the phospholipid chains. This can be explained by an equilibrium between the attraction attributable to the insertion of the myristoyl chain and the Born repulsion. In a 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-L-serine] membrane, where attractive electrostatic interactions come into play, the differences between the peptide and the phospholipid chain lengths were attenuated, and the molecular dynamics of all lipid chains were similar. In a much thicker 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-[phospho-L-serine]/cholesterol membrane, the length of the myristoyl chain of Src was elongated nearly to its maximum, and the order parameters of the Src chain were comparable to those of the surrounding membrane.},

Furthermore it is coupled with the difficult task of designing a reliable force field with which one has to search for the global minimum. A summary of a series of optimization methods developed and applied to various problems involving polypeptide chains is described in this paper.

  Abstract                 = {The interaction of several tryptophan (Trp)-rich cationic antimicrobial peptides with membranes was investigated. These peptides included tritrpticin, indolicidin, lactoferricin B (Lfcin B), and a shorter fragment of lactoferricin (LfcinB4-9). The average environment of the Trp residues of these peptides was assessed from their fluorescence properties, both the wavelength of maximal emission as well as the red edge effect. The insertion of the peptides into vesicles of differing composition was examined using quenching of the Trp fluorescence, with both soluble acrylamide and nitroxide-labelled phospholipids as well as by chemical modification of the Trp residues with N-bromosuccinimide. The results were consistent with the Trp side chains positioned mostly near the membrane-water interface. The extent of burial of the Trp side chains appears to be greater in vesicles containing phospholipids with the anionic phosphatidylglycerol headgroup. Leakage of the aqueous contents of liposomes was also measured using the 8-aminonaphthalene-1,3,6-trisulfonic acid--p-xylene-bis-pyridinium bromide assay. Tritrpticin, which demonstrated the greatest red edge shift, also displayed the largest amount of leakage from liposomes. Taken together, the results illustrate that cationic Trp-rich antimicrobial peptides preferentially disrupt large unilamellar vesicles with a net negative charge following their insertion into the interfacial region of the phospholipid bilayer.},

  abstract    = {G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are a protein family of outstanding pharmaceutical interest. GPCR homology models, based on the crystal structure of bovine rhodopsin, have been shown to be valuable tools in the drug-design process. The initial model is often refined by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, a procedure that has been recently discussed controversially. We therefore analyzed MD simulations of bovine rhodopsin in order to identify contacts that could serve as constraints in the simulation of homology models. Additionally, the effect of an N-terminal truncation, the nature of the membrane mimic, the influence of varying protonation states of buried residues and the importance of internal water molecules was analyzed. All simulations were carried out using the program-package GROMACS. While N-terminal truncation negatively influenced the overall protein stability, a stable simulation was possible in both solvent environments. As regards the protonation state of titratable sites, the experimental data could be reproduced by the program UHBD (University of Houston Brownian Dynamics), suggesting its application for studying homology models of GPCRs. A high flexibility was observed for internal water molecules at some sites. Finally, interhelical hydrogen-bonding interactions could be derived, which can now serve as constraints in the simulations of GPCR homology models.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel approach for boosting antimicrobial peptides through end tagging with hydrophobic oligopeptide stretches is demonstrated. Focusing on two peptides derived from kininogen, GKHKNKGKKNGKHNGWK (GKH17) and HKHGHGHGKHKNKGKKN (HKH17), tagging resulted in enhanced killing of Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative Escherichia coli, and fungal Candida albicans. Microbicidal potency increased with tag length, also in plasma, and was larger for Trp and Phe stretches than for aliphatic ones. The enhanced microbicidal effects correlated to a higher degree of bacterial wall rupture. Analogously, tagging promoted peptide binding to model phospholipid membranes and liposome rupture, particularly for anionic and cholesterol-void membranes. Tagged peptides displayed low toxicity, particularly in the presence of serum, and resisted degradation by human leukocyte elastase and by staphylococcal aureolysin and V8 proteinase. The biological relevance of these findings was demonstrated ex vivo and in vivo in porcine S. aureus skin infection models. The generality of end tagging for facile boosting of antimicrobial peptides without the need for post-synthesis modification was also demonstrated.},

  Abstract                 = {A pronounced membrane selectivity is demonstrated for short, hydrophilic, and highly charged antimicrobial peptides, end-tagged with aromatic amino acid stretches. The mechanisms underlying this were investigated by a method combination of fluorescence and CD spectroscopy, ellipsometry, and Langmuir balance measurements, as well as with functional assays on cell toxicity and antimicrobial effects. End-tagging with oligotryptophan promotes peptide-induced lysis of phospholipid liposomes, as well as membrane rupture and killing of bacteria and fungi. This antimicrobial potency is accompanied by limited toxicity for human epithelial cells and low hemolysis. The functional selectivity displayed correlates to a pronounced selectivity of such peptides for anionic lipid membranes, combined with a markedly reduced membrane activity in the presence of cholesterol. As exemplified for GRR10W4N (GRRPRPRPRPWWWW-NH(2)), potent liposome rupture occurs for anionic lipid systems (dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE)/dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol (DOPG) and Escherichia coli lipid extract) while that of zwitterionic dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC)/cholesterol is largely absent under the conditions investigated. This pronounced membrane selectivity is due to both a lower peptide binding to the zwitterionic membranes (zâ-8-10mV) than to the anionic ones (zâ-35-40mV), and a lower degree of membrane incorporation in the zwitterionic membranes, particularly in the presence of cholesterol. Replacing cholesterol with ergosterol, thus mimicking fungal membranes, results in an increased sensitivity for peptide-induced lysis, in analogy to the antifungal properties of such peptides. Finally, the generality of the high membrane selectivity for other peptides of this type is demonstrated.},

  Abstract                 = {Morphological analysis of a conditional yeast mutant in acetyl-CoA carboxylase acc1ts/mtr7, the rate-limiting enzyme of fatty acid synthesis, suggested that the synthesis of C26 VLCFAs (very-long-chain fatty acids) is important for maintaining the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. To characterize this C26-dependent pathway in more detail, we have now examined cells that are blocked in pathways that require C26. In yeast, ceramide synthesis and remodelling of GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol)-anchors are two pathways that incorporate C26 into lipids. Conditional mutants blocked in either ceramide synthesis or the synthesis of GPI anchors do not display the characteristic alterations of the nuclear envelope observed in acc1ts, indicating that the synthesis of another C26-containing lipid may be affected in acc1ts mutant cells. Lipid analysis of isolated nuclear membranes revealed the presence of a novel C26-substituted PI (phosphatidylinositol). This C26-PI accounts for approx. 1\% of all the PI species, and is present in both the nuclear and the plasma membrane. Remarkably, this C26-PI is the only C26-containing glycerophospholipid that is detectable in wild-type yeast, and the C26-substitution is highly specific for the sn-1 position of the glycerol backbone. To characterize the biophysical properties of this lipid, it was chemically synthesized. In contrast to PIs with normal long-chain fatty acids (C16 or C18), the C26-PI greatly reduced the bilayer to hexagonal phase transition of liposomes composed of 1,2-dielaidoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DEPE). The biophysical properties of this lipid are thus consistent with a possible role in stabilizing highly curved membrane domains.},

These models can provide a human-comprehensible picture of the underlying process, and have been successfully used to study protein folding, protein aggregation, protein ligand binding, and other biophysical systems. The MSM requires the construction of a discrete state-space such that two points are in the same state if they can interconvert rapidly. In the following, we suggest an improved method, which utilizes second order Independent Components Analysis (also known as time-structure based Independent Components Analysis, or tICA), to construct the state-space. We apply this method to simulations of NTL9 (provided by Lindorff-Larsen et al. Science2011), and show that the MSM is an improvement over previously built models using conventional distance metrics. Additionally, the resulting model provides insight into the role of non-native contacts by revealing many slow timescales associated with compact, non-native states.},

  abstract =    {HIV-1 reverse transcriptase is a critical drug target for HIV treatment, and understanding the exact mechanisms of its function and inhibition would significantly accelerate the development of new anti-HIV drugs. It is well known that structure plays a critical role in protein function, but for reverse transcriptase, structural information has proven to be insufficient - despite enormous effort - to explain the mechanism of inhibition and drug resistance of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. We hypothesize that the missing link is dynamics, information about the motions of the system. However, many of the techniques that give the best information about dynamics, such as solution NMR and molecular dynamics simulations, cannot be easily applied to a protein as large as reverse transcriptase. As an alternative, we combine elastic network modeling with simultaneous hierarchical clustering of structural and dynamic data. We present an extensive survey of the dynamics of reverse transcriptase bound to a variety of ligands and with a number of mutations, revealing a novel mechanism for drug resistance to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Hydrophobic core mutations restore active-state motion to multiple functionally significant regions of HIV-1 RT. This model arises out of a combination of structural and dynamic information, rather than exclusively from one or the other. Â© Proteins 2013;. Â© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel protocol for all-atom RNA tertiary structure prediction is presented that uses restrained molecular mechanics and simulated annealing. The restraints are from secondary structure, covariation analysis, coaxial stacking predictions for helices in junctions, and, when available, cross-linking data. Results are demonstrated on the Alu domain of the mammalian signal recognition particle RNA, the Saccharomyces cerevisiae phenylalanine tRNA, the hammerhead ribozyme, the hepatitis C virus internal ribosomal entry site, and the P4-P6 domain of the Tetrahymena thermophila group I intron. The predicted structure is selected from a pool of decoy structures with a score that maximizes radius of gyration and base-base contacts, which was empirically found to select higher quality decoys. This simple ab initio approach is sufficient to make good predictions of the structure of RNAs compared to current crystal structures using both root mean square deviation and the accuracy of base-base contacts.

The solubility of the same compounds, except for tert-BuOAc, 1-PeOAc, and 1-HeOAc, was determined as a function of temperature at 10.0 weight per cent of ethanol in water. From the solubility measurements the standard Gibbs energy (DeltaG(t)(0)), enthalpy (DeltaH(t)(0)), and entropy (DeltaS(t)(0)) of transfer were determined. The calculated thermodynamic functions show that the predominant factors in the transfer of alkyl acetate molecules are the transfer of the cavity and the hydrophobic interaction of the nonpolar alkyl chain. Scaled particle theory calculations were used to determine the thermodynamics of cavity transfer, which were combined with the experimental total transfer quantities to obtain the corresponding interaction transfer quantities. It was found that the Gibbs energy of interaction for the transfer is negative, whereas the enthalpy and entropy of interaction for the transfer are positive; almost complete compensation of enthalpy and entropy components occurs.},

  Abstract                 = {A large variety of antimicrobial peptides have been shown to act, at least in vitro, by poration of the lipid membrane. The nanometre size of these pores, however, complicates their structural characterization by experimental techniques. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations, to study the interaction of a specific class of antimicrobial peptides, melittin, with a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer in atomic detail. We show that transmembrane pores spontaneously form above a critical peptide to lipid ratio. The lipid molecules bend inwards to form a toroidally shaped pore but with only one or two peptides lining the pore. This is in strong contrast to the traditional models of toroidal pores in which the peptides are assumed to adopt a transmembrane orientation. We find that peptide aggregation, either prior or after binding to the membrane surface, is a prerequisite to pore formation. The presence of a stable helical secondary structure of the peptide, however is not. Furthermore, results obtained with modified peptides point to the importance of electrostatic interactions in the poration process. Removing the charges of the basic amino-acid residues of melittin prevents pore formation. It was also found that in the absence of counter ions pores not only form more rapidly but lead to membrane rupture. The rupture process occurs via a novel recursive poration pathway, which we coin the Droste mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an extension of the coarse-grained MARTINI model for proteins and apply this extension to amyloid- and elastin-like peptides. Atomistic simulations of tetrapeptides, octapeptides, and longer peptides in solution are used as a reference to parametrize a set of pseudodihedral potentials that describe the internal flexibility of MARTINI peptides. We assess the performance of the resulting model in reproducing various structural properties computed from atomistic trajectories of peptides in water. The addition of new dihedral angle potentials improves agreement with the contact maps computed from atomistic simulations significantly. We also address the question of which parameters derived from atomistic trajectories are transferable between different lengths of peptides. The modified coarse-grained model shows reasonable transferability of parameters for the amyloid- and elastin-like peptides. In addition, the improved coarse-grained model is also applied to investigate the self-assembly of Î²-sheet forming peptides on the microsecond time scale. The octapeptides SNNFGAIL and (GV)(4) are used to examine peptide aggregation in different environments, in water, and at the water-octane interface. At the interface, peptide adsorption occurs rapidly, and peptides spontaneously aggregate in favor of stretched conformers resembling Î²-strands.},

The radius of gyration (Rg) and Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) have been used as order parameters to follow the unfolding process. Distributions of Rg were used to identify ensembles.Three ensembles could be identified. While the native-state ensemble shows an Rg distribution that is slightly skewed, the second ensemble, which is presumably the Transition State Ensemble (TSE), shows an excellent fit. The denatured ensemble shows large fluctuations, but a Gaussian curve could be fitted. This means that the unfolding process is two-state.

Molecular dynamics simulation is a powerful tool that can unravel whole pathways of protein folding/unfolding at atomic resolution. We have performed several molecular dynamics simulations, to a total of over 250 ns, of a beta-hairpin peptide in water using GROMACS. We show that hydrophobic interactions are necessary for initiating the folding of the peptide. Once formed, the peptide is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and disruption of hydrophobic interactions in the folded peptide does not denature the structure. In the absence of hydrophobic interactions, the peptide fails to fold. However, the introduction of a salt-bridge compensates for the loss of hydrophobic interactions to a certain extent.},

We studied the interaction of the human multifunctional peptide LL-37 with single phospholipid monolayers, bilayers and bilayers composed of binary mixtures of the four phospholipid species predominantly used in model membrane experiments (phosphatidyl-choline, -ethanolamine, -glycerol and -serine). We found (i) that the effects on single lipid monolayers are not comparable to those on the corresponding bilayers, (ii) four different effects of LL-37 on bilayers of the four lipids, (iii) that the preference of LL-37 for the specific lipids is roughly inversely related to chain packing density and (iv) that in the binary lipid mixtures one lipid generally governs the mode of lipid/peptide interaction, which is not necessarily the charged one. Thus, our results show that lipid net charge is not the decisive factor determining the membrane-perturbing mechanism of LL-37 but only one of several parameters, among them packing density, the ability to form intermolecular H-bonds and lipid molecular shape, emphasizing how profoundly the choice of the model system can influence the outcome of a study of lipid/peptide interaction. 10.1529/biophysj.107.123620},

We present a framework for modeling the spin label dynamics by using trajectories such as those from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with stochastic treatment of the global protein tumbling. This is achieved in the time domain after two efficient numerical integrators are developed: One for the quantal dynamics of the spins and the other for the classical rotational diffusion. For the quantal dynamics, we propagate the relevant part of the spin density matrix in Hilbert space. For the diffusional tumbling, we work with quaternions, which enables the treatment of anisotropic diffusion in a potential expanded as a sum of spherical harmonics. Time-averaging arguments are invoked to bridge the gap between the smaller time step of the MD trajectories and the larger time steps appropriate for the rotational diffusion and/or quantal spin dynamics.

Characterization of the interactions between rhodopsin and transducin, its intracellular G-protein counterpart, and the fluctuations in these interactions due to thermal motions is required for an understanding of early events in the mechanism of signal transduction. In this study, we used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of a transmembrane protein complex between rhodopsin and the heterotrimeric transducin (GÃÂ±ÃÂ²ÃÂ³) in an all-atom DOPC (1,2-dioleoylsn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) membraneÃ¢ÂÂwater environment. Based on the analysis of a microsecond-timescale simulation trajectory, we characterized the dynamics of the system and its effects in the structural features of the protein subunits. Our simulations describe a highly dynamic interaction interface where the system is alternating between distinct domain orientations at the 10- to 100-ns timescale that can be further classified into interaction modes involving contacts between distinct structural features on the protein subunits. We related our results with experimental measurements from a variety of studies and high-resolution models of activated rhodopsin. Monitoring key structural features that are involved in the activation process along our simulation trajectory indicates the presence of extensive dynamics in the dark-adapted state, including a motion of Y223 from helix 3 toward the Ã¢ÂÂ ionic-lockÃ¢ÂÂ interactions of the conserved ERY motif. The dynamic picture shown here is consistent with a framework in which the dark-state fluctuations sample conformations consistent with the activated state. These results provide an atomic-level description of the dynamics of the full complex and further suggest novel mutagenesis experiments that can be used to investigate the stability and dynamics of this model membrane protein receptor system.},

  Abstract                 = {The dramatically increased frequency of opportunistic fungal infections has prompted research to diversify the arsenal of antifungal agents. Antimicrobial peptides constitute a promising family for future antibiotics with a new mode of action. However, only a few are effective against fungal pathogens because of their ability to self-assemble. Recently, we showed that the conjugation of fatty acids to the potent antibacterial peptide magainin endowed it with antifungal activity concomitant with an increase in its oligomeric state in solution. To investigate whether a high potency of the parental peptide is prerequisite for antifungal activity, we conjugated undecanoic acid (UA) and palmitic acid (PA) to inactive diastereomers of magainin containing four d-amino acids ([D]-4-magainin), as well as to a weakly active diastereomeric lytic peptide containing Lys and Leu ([D]-K(5)L(7)). All lipopeptides gained potent activity toward Cryptococcus neoformans. Most importantly, [D]-K(5)L(7)-UA was highly potent against all microorganisms tested, including bacteria, yeast, and opportunistic fungi. All lipopeptides increased the permeability of Escherichia coli spheroplasts and intact C. neoformans, as well as their corresponding membranes, phosphatidylethanol (PE)/phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC)/PE/phosphatidylinositol (PI)/ergosterol, respectively. The extent of membrane-permeating activity correlated with their biological function, suggesting that the plasma membrane was one of their major targets. Circular dichroism (CD) and attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy revealed that their mode of oligomerization in solution, structure, and organization in membranes have important roles regarding their antibacterial and antifungal activities. Together with the advantage of using diastereomers versus all l-amino acid peptides, this study paves the way to the design of a new group of potent antifungal peptides urgently needed to combat opportunistic fungal infection.},

  Abstract                 = {Water-membrane soluble protein and peptide toxins are used in the defense and offense systems of all organisms, including plants and humans. A major group includes antimicrobial peptides, which serve as a nonspecific defense system that complements the highly specific cell-mediated immune response. The increasing resistance of bacteria to conventional antibiotics stimulated the isolation and characterization of many antimicrobial peptides for potential use as new target antibiotics. The finding of thousands of antimicrobial peptides with variable lengths and sequences, all of which are active at similar concentrations, suggests a general mechanism for killing bacteria rather than a specific mechanism that requires preferred active structures. Such a mechanism is in agreement with the "carpet model" that does not require any specific structure or sequence. It seems that when there is an appropriate balance between hydrophobicity and a net positive charge the peptides are active on bacteria. However, selective activity depends also on other parameters, such as the volume of the molecule, its structure, and its oligomeric state in solution and membranes. Further, although many studies support that bacterial membrane damage is a lethal event for bacteria, other studies point to a multihit mechanism in which the peptide binds to several targets in the cytoplasmic region of the bacteria.},

  Abstract                 = {Endogenous peptide antibiotics (termed also host-defense or antimicrobial peptides) are known as evolutionarily old components of innate immunity. They were found initially in invertebrates, but later on also in vertebrates, including humans. This secondary, chemical immune system provides organisms with a repertoire of small peptides that act against invasion (for both offensive and defensive purposes) by occasional and obligate pathogens. Each antimicrobial peptide has a broad but not identical spectrum of antimicrobial activity, predominantly against bacteria, providing the host maximum coverage against a rather broad spectrum of microbial organisms. Many of these peptides interact with the target cell membranes and increase their permeability, which results in cell lysis. A second important family includes lipopeptides. They are produced in bacteria and fungi during cultivation on various carbon sources, and possess a strong antifungal activity. Unfortunately, native lipopeptides are non-cell selective and therefore extremely toxic to mammalian cells. Whereas extensive studies have emerged on the requirements for a peptide to be antibacterial, very little is known concerning the parameters that contribute to antifungal activity. This review summarizes recent studies aimed to understand how antimicrobial peptides and lipopeptides select their target cell. This includes a new group of lipopeptides highly potent against pathogenic fungi and yeast. They are composed of inert cationic peptides conjugated to aliphatic acids with different lengths. Deep understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the differential cells specificity of these families of host defense molecule is required to meet the challenges imposed by the life-threatening infections.},

  Abstract                 = {Living organisms of all types produce a large repertoire of gene-encoded, net positively charged, antimicrobial peptides as part of their innate immunity to microbial invasion. Despite significant variations in composition, length and secondary structure most antimicrobial peptides are active in micromolar concentrations, suggesting a common general mechanism for their mode of action. Many antimicrobial peptides bind bacterial phospholipid membranes up to a threshold concentration, followed by membrane permeation/disintegration (the "carpet" mechanism). Recent data suggest that the details of the permeation pathways may vary for different peptides and are assigned to different modes of action. Accumulating data reveal that the molecular basis for cell selectivity is the ability of peptides to specifically bind the negatively charged bacterial membrane, as well as their oligomeric state in solution and in the membrane. Based on the "carpet" mechanism and the role of the peptide oligomeric state, a novel group of diastereomeric (containing D- and L-amino acids) antimicrobial peptides were developed. These peptides may serve as promising templates for the future designs of antimicrobial peptides.},

  Abstract                 = {Various lipopeptides produced by Bacillus subtilis were examined for their ability to modify the surface hydrophobicity of two substrata, stainless steel (SS) and Teflon. These modifications were evaluated by water contact angle measurements. The effects depended on the lipopeptide, its concentration, and the tested substratum. Treatment of SS with different concentrations of surfactin S1 showed an increase of the hydrophobicity between 1 and 100 mg l(-1). On the same substratum, fengycin increased hydrophobicity up to its critical micelle concentration (6.25 mg l(-1)). With higher concentrations of fengycin, hydrophobicity decreased. Surfactin, mycosubtilin, and iturin A decreased hydrophobicity on Teflon. The different effects of these three families of lipopeptides were related to their structural differences. A good correlation was shown between hydrophobicity modifications of surfaces and the attachment of B. cereus 98/4 spores. Enhancement in the hydrophobicity of the surfaces increased the number of adhering spores.},

  Abstract                 = {The interaction between bovine cytochrome b(5) (cyt b(5)) and horse heart cytochrome c (cyt c) is investigated by NMR spectroscopy. Chemical shifts of cyt b(5) backbone resonances and side chain methyl resonances were monitored as a function of cyt c concentration. The shifts are small but saturatable and indicate that the binding of cyt b(5) with cyt c is in fast exchange. An equilibrium association constant of (6 +/- 3) x 10(4) M(-1) was obtained with a lower limit of 180 s(-1) for the dissociation rate of the complex. To resolve considerable ambiguities in the interpretation of the chemical shift mapping, (15)N relaxation experiments and cross-saturation experiments were used as alternative methods to map the cyt b(5)-cyt c binding interface. Results from the three experiments combined demonstrate that the conserved negatively charged region of cyt b(5) surrounding the solvent-exposed heme edge is involved in the interaction with cyt c. These data support the models proposed by Salemme and Mauk [(1976) J. Mol. Biol. 102, 563-568; (1993) Biochemistry 32, 6613-6623].},

  Abstract                 = {5-Hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT2A) receptors are essential for the actions of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) on physiological processes as diverse as vascular smooth muscle contraction, platelet aggregation, perception, and emotion. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism(s) by which 5-HT activates 5-HT2A receptors using a combination of approaches including site-directed mutagenesis, molecular modeling, and pharmacological analysis using the sensitive, cell-based functional assay R-SAT. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of residues close to the intracellular end of H6 of the 5-HT2A receptor implicated glutamate Glu-318(6.30) in receptor activation, as also predicted by a newly constructed molecular model of the 5-HT2A receptor, which was based on the x-ray structure of bovine rhodopsin. Close examination of the molecular model suggested that Glu-318(6.30) could form a strong ionic interaction with Arg-173(3.50) of the highly conserved "(D/E)RY motif" located at the interface between the third transmembrane segment and the second intracellular loop (i2). A direct prediction of this hypothesis, that disrupting this ionic interaction by an E318(6.30)R mutation would lead to a highly constitutively active receptor with enhanced affinity for agonist, was confirmed using R-SAT. Taken together, these results predict that the disruption of a strong ionic interaction between transmembrane helices 3 and 6 of 5-HT2A receptors is essential for agonist-induced receptor activation and, as recently predicted by ourselves (B. L. Roth and D. A. Shapiro (2001) Expert Opin. Ther. Targets 5, 685-695) and others, that this may represent a general mechanism of activation for many, but not all, G-protein-coupled receptors.},

Nonpolar solutes cause a concerted decrease in the average length and angle of the water-water hydrogen bonds in the first hydration shell, while polar and ionic solutes have the opposite effect. This is due to changes in the amounts, relative to bulk water, of two populations of hydrogen bonds: one with shorter and more linear bonds and the other with longer and more bent bonds. Heat capacity changes were calculated from these changes in water structure using a random network model equation of state. The calculated changes account for observed differences in Delta C-p(hyd) for the various solutes. The simulations provide a unified picture of hydrophobic and polar hydration, and both a structural and thermodynamic explanation of the opposite signs of Delta C- p(hyd) observed for polar and nonpolar solutes.},

The measurements were performed at four different temperatures and 0.1 M KCl, and thus the thermodynamic parameters of ionization and transfer were evaluated. The ionization of cephradine has been found to be endothermic and entropically unfavourable. A non-linear dependence of the ionization Gibbs energies (Delta (diss)G degrees) on the mole fraction of 1,4-dioxane and the reciprocal of the dielectric constant of the solvent mixtures was observed. The variation of the Delta (diss)G degrees values (and thus pK(a) values) obtained over the whole composition range studied can be explained in terms of preferential solvation of cephradine in 1,4-dioxane-water mixtures. Both Delta (diss)G degrees and Delta S-diss degrees were linearly related to Delta H-diss degrees given isoequilibrium relationships. The Delta H-diss degrees-Delta S-diss degrees susceptibilities are different for the first and second ionization processes as well as for water-rich and 1,4-dioxane- rich zones. On the basis of the standard Gibbs energies of hydrogen ion from water to 1,4-dioxane-water mixtures, Delta (trans)G degrees (H+) and the relative values of ionized and unionized species of cephradine, the effect of solvent on its ionization in 1,4-dioxane-water mixtures is clarified. The Delta (diss)G degrees values are well correlated with the solvent polarity parameter of Dimroth and Reichardt, E-T(30). The linear solvation energy relationships method (LSER) was also applied to correlate the thermodynamic parameters with the Kamlet and Taft solvatochromic parameters (alpha, beta, pi*) of 1,4-dioxane-water mixtures. Thus, calculation of the thermodynamic parameters of ionization and transfer in any 1,4- dioxane-water mixtures up to 90% (v/v) can be done using the obtained equations.},

We consider recent developments and representative applications of mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), elastic network models (ENMs), coarse-grained molecular dynamics, and grid-based tools for calculating interactions between essentially rigid protein assemblies. We consider how the different length scales can be coupled, both in a sequential fashion (e.g. a coarse-grained or grid model using parameterization from MD simulations), and via concurrent approaches, where the calculations are performed together and together control the progression of the simulation. We suggest how the concurrent coupling approach familiar in the context of QM/MM calculations can be generalized, and describe how this has been done in the CHARMM macromolecular simulation package.},

In this model, the gA peptide was described in full atomistic detail, while the lipid and water molecules were described using coarse-grained representations. The atom-CG and CG-CG interactions in the mixed AA-CG model were determined using the MS-CG method. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using the resulting AA-CG model. The results from simulations of the AA-CG model compare very favorably to those from all-atom MD simulations of the entire system. Since the MS-CG method employs a general and systematic approach to obtain effective interactions from the underlying all-atom models, the present approach to rigorously develop mixed AA-CG models has the potential to be extended to many other systems.},

  Abstract                 = {An approach to bridging the phenomenological field theory description of phase separation in binary mixed lipid bilayers with coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is presented. CG MD simulation is carried out for a 1:1 dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine/dipalmitoylphosphatidylethanolamine lipid mixture at the liquid-gel phase coexistence condition. The liquid-gel phase separation can be characterized by the bilayer thickness, area per lipid molecule, and orientation parameter of the lipid tails. After a local order parameter is defined using the lipid tail bond orientation parameter, the CG MD data are bridged to a mesoscopic model based on the phenomenological Landau-Ginzberg free-energy functional. All parameters in this mesoscopic model are defined from the information of the phase boundary structure and the distributions of the order parameter in the liquid and gel phases. It is found that the mesoscopic model reproduces the equilibrium properties of the system very well, including collective fluctuations in both phases, spatial correlation functions of the order parameter, and the line tension. The possibility of using a time-dependent Landau-Ginzberg model to mimic the phase-separation dynamics is also investigated, using the relaxation time constant obtained by fitting the time-dependent correlation functions of the order parameter.},

  Abstract                 = {A coarse-grained model for molecular dynamics simulations is extended from lipids to proteins. In the framework of such models pioneered by Klein, atoms are described group-wise by beads, with the interactions between beads governed by effective potentials. The extension developed here is based on a coarse-grained lipid model developed previously by Marrink et al., although future versions will reconcile the approach taken with the systematic approach of Klein and other authors. Each amino acid of the protein is represented by two coarse-grained beads, one for the backbone (identical for all residues) and one for the side-chain (which differs depending on the residue type). The coarse-graining reduces the system size about 10-fold and allows integration time steps of 25-50 fs. The model is applied to simulations of discoidal high-density lipoprotein particles involving water, lipids, and two primarily helical proteins. These particles are an ideal test system for the extension of coarse-grained models. Our model proved to be reliable in maintaining the shape of preassembled particles and in reproducing the overall structural features of high-density lipoproteins accurately. Microsecond simulations of lipoprotein assembly revealed the formation of a protein-lipid complex in which two proteins are attached to either side of a discoidal lipid bilayer.},

In an effort to better understand the factors controlling peptide amphiphile (PA) micellar shape, we synthetically linked a short peptide with an ÃÂ±-helix-forming tendency to a hexadecyl tail. These molecules initially dissolve as spherical micelles, which can persist for hours or days, followed by transformation to wormlike micelles, which occurs simultaneously with a transition in the secondary structure of the headgroup peptides to ÃÂ²-sheet. This observation provides evidence that the extended micelle is the thermodynamically favored state sought by PA micelles in the process of forming ÃÂ²-sheet structures among the head-groups, though they are not the structures formed during the initial kinetics of assembly.},

A diphytanyl phosphatidylcholine bilayer is used for our test calculations.

We demonstrated previously that mutations of the hapten contact residue HTrp-100 to Arg (where H refers to the heavy chain) resulted in increased specificity for digoxin analogs substituted at the cardenolide 16 position. However, mutagenesis of H:CDR1 did not result in such a specificity change despite the proximity of the H:CDR1 hapten contact residue Asn-35 to the cardenolide 16 position. Here we constructed a bacteriophage-displayed library containing randomized mutations at H chain residues 30-35 in a 26-10 mutant containing Arg-100 (26-10-RRALD). Phage were selected by panning against digoxin, gitoxin (16-OH), and 16-acetylgitoxin coupled to bovine serum albumin. Clones that retained wild-type Asn at position 35 showed preferred binding to gitoxin, like the 26-10-RRALD parent. In contrast, clones containing Val-35 selected mainly on digoxin-bovine serum albumin demonstrated a shift back to wild-type specificity. Several clones containing Val-35 bound digoxin with increased affinity, approaching that of the wild type in a few instances, in contrast to the mutation Val-35 in the wild-type 26-10 background, which reduces affinity for digoxin 90-fold. It has therefore proven possible to reorder the 26-10 binding site by mutations including two major contact residues on opposite sides of the site and yet to retain high affinity for binding for digoxin. Thus, even among antibodies that have undergone affinity maturation in vivo, different structural solutions to high affinity binding may be revealed.},

  abstract    = {We studied the mechanism of the lamellar-to-inverted hexagonal (L alpha/H[II]) phase transition, using time-resolved cryotransmission electron microscopy (TRC-TEM), 31P-NMR, and differential scanning calorimetry. The transition was initiated in dispersions of large unilamellar vesicles of dipalmitoleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DiPoPE). We present evidence that the transition proceeds in three steps. First, many small connections form between apposed membranes. Second, the connections aggregate within the planes of the bilayers, forming arrays with hexagonal order in some projections. Third, these quasihexagonal structures elongate into small domains of H(II) phase, acquiring lipid molecules by diffusion from contiguous bilayers. A previously proposed membrane fusion mechanism rationalizes these results. The modified stalk theory predicts that the L alpha/H(II) phase transition involves some of the same intermediate structures as membrane fusion. The small interbilayer connections observed via TRC-TEM are compatible with the structure of a critical intermediate in the modified stalk mechanism: the trans monolayer contact (TMC). The theory predicts that 1) TMCs should form starting at tens of degrees below TH; 2) when TMCs become sufficiently numerous, they should aggregate into transient arrays like the quasihexagonal arrays observed here by TRC-TEM; and 3) these quasihexagonal arrays can then elongate directly into H(II) phase domains. These predictions rationalize the principal features of our data, which are incompatible with the other transition mechanisms proposed to date. Thus these results support the modified stalk mechanism for both membrane fusion and the L alpha/H(II) phase transition. We also discuss some implications of the modified stalk theory for fusion in protein-containing systems. Specifically, we point out that recent data on the effects of hydrophobic peptides and viral fusion peptides on lipid phase behavior are consistent with an effect of the peptides on TMC stability.},

  abstract             = {Universal features of the peptide aggregation process suggest a common mechanism, with a first-order phase transition in aqueous solutions of the peptides being the driving force. Small system sizes strongly affect the stability of the minor phase in the two-phase region. We show manifestations of this effect in aqueous solutions of fragments of the islet amyloid polypeptide, using computer simulation methods and invoking various approaches in characterizing clustering and aggregate formation. These systems with peptide concentrations deeply inside the immiscibility region show two distinct stable states, which interchange with time: one state contains a peptide aggregate; and the other state has an aggregate that is noticeably dissolved. The first state is relevant for macroscopic systems, whereas the second one is artificial. At a fixed concentration, the occurrence probability of the aggregate state vanishes upon decreasing the system size, thus indicating the necessity to apply a finite size-scaling for meaningful studies of peptide aggregation by simulations. The effect observed may be one of the factors responsible for the difference between intracellular and extracellular aggregation and fibrillization of polypeptides. The finite size of biological cells or their compartments may be playing a decisive role in hampering intracellular aggregation of highly insoluble amyloidogenic proteins, whereas aggregation is unavoidable in the extracellular space at the same peptide concentration. 10.1529/biophysj.108.136226},

Molecular dynamics simulations of L  phase dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC), dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and cholesterol show that oxygen and water transit a leaflet through the DOPC and cholesterol rich boundaries of hexagonally packed DPPC microdomains, freely diffuse along the bilayer midplane, and escape the membrane along the boundary regions. Electron paramagnetic resonance experiments provide critical validation: the measured ratio of oxygen concentrations near the midplanes of liquid disordered (L ) and L  bilayers of DPPC/DOPC/cholesterol is 1.75âÂ±â0.35, in very good agreement with 1.3âÂ±â0.3 obtained from simulation.

  abstract        = {The balance of normal and radial (lateral) diffusion of oxygen in phospholipid membranes is critical for biological function. Based on the Smoluchowski equation for the inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion model, Bayesian analysis (BA) can be applied to molecular dynamics trajectories of oxygen to extract the free energy and the normal and radial diffusion profiles. This paper derives a theoretical formalism to convert these profiles into characteristic times and lengths associated with entering, escaping, or completely crossing the membrane. The formalism computes mean first passage times and holds for any process described by rate equations between discrete states. BA of simulations of eight model membranes with varying lipid composition and temperature indicate that oxygen travels 3 to 5 times further in the radial than in the normal direction when crossing the membrane in a time of 15 to 32 ns, thereby confirming the anisotropy of passive oxygen transport in membranes. Moreover, the preceding times and distances estimated from the BA are compared to the aggregate of 280 membrane exits explicitly observed in the trajectories. BA predictions for the distances of oxygen radial diffusion within the membrane are statistically indistinguishable from the corresponding simulation values, yet BA oxygen exit times from the membrane interior are approximately 20% shorter than the simulation values, averaged over seven systems. The comparison supports the BA approach and, therefore, the applicability of the Smoluchowski equation to membrane diffusion. Given the shorter trajectories required for the BA, these results validate the BA as a computationally attractive alternative to direct observation of exits when estimating characteristic times and radial distances. The effect of collective membrane undulations on the BA is also discussed.},

  abstract        = {A Bayesian-based methodology is developed to estimate diffusion tensors from molecular dynamics simulations of permeants in anisotropic media, and is applied to oxygen in lipid bilayers. By a separation of variables in the Smoluchowski diffusion equation, the multidimensional diffusion is reduced to coupled one-dimensional diffusion problems that are treated by discretization. The resulting diffusivity profiles characterize the membrane transport dynamics as a function of the position across the membrane, discriminating between diffusion normal and parallel to the membrane. The methodology is first validated with neat water, neat hexadecane, and a hexadecane slab surrounded by water, the latter being a simple model for a lipid membrane. Next, a bilayer consisting of pure 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), and a bilayer mimicking the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane, including cardiolipin, are investigated. We analyze the detailed time evolution of oxygen molecules, in terms of both normal diffusion through and radial diffusion inside the membrane. Diffusion is fast in the more loosely packed interleaflet region, and anisotropic, with oxygen spreading more rapidly in the membrane plane than normal to it. Visualization of the propagator shows that oxygen enters the membrane rapidly, reaching its thermodynamically favored center in about 1 ns, despite the free energy barrier at the headgroup region. Oxygen transport is quantified by computing the oxygen permeability of the membranes and the average radial diffusivity, which confirm the anisotropy of the diffusion. The position-dependent diffusion constants and free energies are used to construct compartmental models and test assumptions used in estimating permeability, including Overton's rule. In particular, a hexadecane slab surrounded by water is found to be a poor model of oxygen transport in membranes because the relevant energy barriers differ substantially.},

  abstract        = {Permeability ( ) across biological membranes is of fundamental importance and a key factor in drug absorption, distribution, and development. Although the majority of drugs will be charged at some point during oral delivery, our understanding of membrane permeation by charged species is limited. The canonical model assumes that only neutral molecules partition into and passively permeate across membranes, but there is mounting evidence that these processes are also facile for certain charged species. However, it is unknown whether such ionizable permeants dynamically neutralize at the membrane surface or permeate in their charged form. To probe protonation-coupled permeation in atomic detail, we herein apply continuous constant-pH molecular dynamics along with free energy sampling to study the permeation of a weak base propranolol (PPL), and evaluate the impact of including dynamic protonation on  . The simulations reveal that PPL dynamically neutralizes at the lipid-tail interface, which dramatically influences the permeation free energy landscape and explains why the conventional model overestimates the assigned intrinsic permeability. We demonstrate how fixed-charge-state simulations can account for this effect, and propose a revised model that better describes pH-coupled partitioning and permeation. Our results demonstrate how dynamic changes in protonation state may play a critical role in the permeation of ionizable molecules, including pharmaceuticals and drug-like molecules, thus requiring a revision of the standard picture.},

Microbes can be genetically engineered to produce fatty acid-derived products that are able to cross host membranes and can be extracted into an applied organic overlay. This process is thought to be passive, with a rate dependent on the chemistry of the crossing compound. The relationship between the chemical composition and the energetics and kinetics of product accumulation within the overlay is not well understood. Through biased and unbiased molecular simulation, we compute the membrane permeability coefficients from production to extraction for different fatty acyl products, including fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty aldehydes, alkanes, and alkenes. These simulations identify specific interactions that accelerate the transit of aldehydes across the membrane bilayer relative to other oxidized products, specifically the lack of hydrogen bonds to the surrounding membrane environment. However, since extraction from the outer membrane leaflet into the organic phase is found to be rate limiting for the entire process, we find that fatty alcohols and fatty aldehydes would both manifest similar fluxes into a dodecane overlay under equivalent conditions, outpacing the accumulation of acids or alkanes into the organic phase. Since aldehydes are known to be highly reactive as well as toxic in high quantities, the findings suggest that indeed fatty alcohols are the optimal long-tail fatty acyl product for extraction.},

  abstract        = {Terpenoids constitute a class of compounds with remarkable potential for pharmaceutical, fragrance, specialty chemical, and biofuel applications. However, their industrial production is limited by their rarity within their native plant hosts, creating considerable interest in microbial hosts capable of manufacturing terpenoids. To reduce production costs, nondestructive product recovery from these microbial hosts is preferred, and is achievable using a hydrophobic organic overlay. Our prior research has indicated that oxidized fatty acyl products may permeate faster through host membranes, increasing overall biorefinery productivity. To test this hypothesis for terpenoids, we computed membrane permeabilities of conventional terpenoid target products (e.g., limonene, bisabolene, farnesene) and related oxidized compounds through molecular dynamics simulations. These simulations indicate that terpenoid product permeabilities from cytosol to overlay are oxidation independent, as increases in membrane extraction efficiency due to product oxidation are proportionally offset by decreases in the membrane crossing rate if the membrane and organic phase are in close contact. However, if aqueous extraction is required, oxidation will accelerate the slow product extraction from the membrane. Experimental toxicity assays performed indicated that most terpenoids tested were tolerated by microbial hosts, although exposure to oxidized terpenes often retarded microbial growth compared with conventional terpenes. Thus, terpenoid oxidation is not expected to significantly increase or decrease the extraction productivity in an industrial setting where cells are in close contact, unlike the previously studied fatty acyl products.},

  abstract        = {Lignin is an abundant aromatic polymer found in plant secondary cell walls. In recent years, lignin has attracted renewed interest as a feedstock for bio-based chemicals via catalytic and biological approaches and has emerged as a target for genetic engineering to improve lignocellulose digestibility by altering its composition. In lignin biosynthesis and microbial conversion, small phenolic lignin precursors or degradation products cross membrane bilayers through an unidentified translocation mechanism prior to incorporation into lignin polymers (synthesis) or catabolism (bioconversion), with both passive and transporter-assisted mechanisms postulated. To test the passive permeation potential of these phenolics, we performed molecular dynamics simulations for 69 monomeric and dimeric lignin-related phenolics with 3 model membranes to determine the membrane partitioning and permeability coefficients for each compound. The results support an accessible passive permeation mechanism for most compounds, including monolignols, dimeric phenolics, and the flavonoid, tricin. Computed lignin partition coefficients are consistent with concentration enrichment near lipid carbonyl groups, and permeability coefficients are sufficient to keep pace with cellular metabolism. Interactions between methoxy and hydroxy groups are found to reduce membrane partitioning and improve permeability. Only carboxylate-modified or glycosylated lignin phenolics are predicted to require transporters for membrane translocation. Overall, the results suggest that most lignin-related compounds can passively traverse plant and microbial membranes on timescales commensurate with required biological activities, with any potential transport regulation mechanism in lignin synthesis, catabolism, or bioconversion requiring compound functionalization.},

  abstract        = {Beta-arrestins are key negative regulators and scaffolds of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling. Beta-arrestin1 and beta-arrestin2 preferentially bind to the phosphorylated GPCRs in response to agonist stimulation, resulting in receptor internalization and desensitization. The critical roles of GPCR kinases (GRKs)-catalyzed receptor phosphorylation and interaction of beta-arrestins with the phosphorylated receptor in receptor internalization are well established. However, emerging evidence suggests that an agonist-stimulated internalization mechanism that is independent of receptor phosphorylation may also be employed in some cases, although the molecular mechanism for the phosphorylation-independent GPCR internalization is not clear. The current study investigated the role of receptor phosphorylation and the involvement of different beta-arrestin subtypes in agonist-induced delta-opioid receptor (DOR) internalization in HEK293 cells. Results from flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and surface biotin labelling experiments showed that elimination of agonist-induced DOR phosphorylation by mutation GRK binding or phosphorylation sites only partially blocked agonist-induced receptor internalization, indicating the presence of an agonist-induced, GRK-independent mechanism for DOR internalization. Fluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation studies indicated that both the wild-type DOR and the phosphorylation-deficient mutant receptor could bind and recruit beta-arrestin1 and beta-arrestin2 to the plasma membrane in an agonist-stimulated manner. Furthermore, internalization of both the wild-type and phosphorylation-deficient receptors was increased by overexpression of either type of beta-arrestins and blocked by dominant-negative mutants of beta-arrestin-mediated internalization, demonstrating that both phosphorylation-dependent and -independent internalization require beta-arrestin. Moreover, double-stranded RNA-mediated interference experiments showed that either beta-arrestin1 or beta-arrestin2 subtype-specific RNAi only partially inhibited agonist-induced internalization of the wild-type DOR. However, agonist-induced internalization of the phosphorylation-deficient DOR was not affected by beta-arrestin1-specific RNAi but was blocked by RNAi against beta-arrestin2 subtype. These data indicate that endogenous beta-arrestin1 functions exclusively in the phosphorylation-dependent receptor internalization, whereas endogenous beta-arrestin2, but not beta-arrestin1, is required for the phosphorylation-independent receptor internalization. These results thus provide the first evidence of different requirement for beta-arrestin isoforms in the agonist induced phosphorylation-dependent and -independent GPCR internalization.},

  abstract        = {Morphine is a widely used analgesic in humans that is associated with multiple untoward effects, such as addiction and physical dependence. In rodent models, morphine also induces locomotor activity. These effects likely involve functionally selective mechanisms. Indeed, G protein-coupled receptor desensitization and adaptor protein Î²-arrestin 2 (Î²arr2) through its interaction with the Î¼-opioid receptor regulates the analgesic but not the rewarding properties of morphine. However, Î²arr2 is also required for morphine-induced locomotor activity in mice, but the exact cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate this arrestin-dependent behavior are not understood. In this study, we show that Î²arr2 is required for morphine-induced locomotor activity in a dopamine D1 receptor (D1R)-dependent manner and that a Î²arr2/phospho-ERK (Î²arr2/pERK) signaling complex may mediate this behavior. Systemic administration of SL327, an MEK inhibitor, inhibits morphine-induced locomotion in wild-type mice in a dose-dependent manner. Acute morphine administration to mice promotes the formation of a Î²arr2/pERK signaling complex. Morphine-induced locomotor activity and formation of the Î²arr2/pERK signaling complex is blunted in D1R knockout (D1-KO) mice and is presumably independent of D2 dopamine receptors. However, D1Rs are not required for morphine-induced reward as D1-KO mice show the same conditioned place preference for morphine as do control mice. Taken together, these results suggest a potential role for a D1R-dependent Î²arr2/pERK signaling complex in selectively mediating the locomotor-stimulating but not the rewarding properties of morphine.},

Here we discuss the current state of research concerning the contribution of  arr2 to the psychomotor and rewarding effects of addictive drugs. Next we identify key knowledge gaps and suggest new tools and approaches needed to further elucidate the neuroanatomical substrates and neurobiological mechanisms to explain how  arr2 modulates behavioral responses to drugs of abuse, as well as its potential as a therapeutic target.},

  abstract        = {Opioid therapeutics are excellent analgesics, whose utility is compromised by dependence. Morphine (1) and its clinically relevant derivatives such as OxyContin (2), Vicodin (3), and Dilaudid (4) are "biased" agonists at the Î¼ opioid receptor (OR), wherein they engage G protein signaling but poorly engage Î²-arrestin and the endocytic machinery. In contrast, endorphins, the endogenous peptide agonists for ORs, are potent analgesics, show reduced liability for tolerance and dependence, and engage both G protein and Î²-arrestin pathways as "balanced" agonists. We set out to determine if marine-derived alkaloids could serve as novel OR agonist chemotypes with a signaling profile distinct from morphine and more similar to the endorphins. Screening of 96 sponge-derived extracts followed by LC-MS-based purification to pinpoint the active compounds and subsequent evaluation of a mini library of related alkaloids identified two structural classes that modulate the ORs. These included the following: aaptamine (10), 9-demethyl aaptamine (11), demethyl (oxy)-aaptamine (12) with activity at the Î´-OR (EC : 5.1, 4.1, 2.3 Î¼M, respectively) and fascaplysin (17), and 10-bromo fascaplysin (18) with activity at the Î¼-OR (EC : 6.3, 4.2 Î¼M respectively). An in vivo evaluation of 10 using Î´-KO mice indicated its previously reported antidepressant-like effects are dependent on the Î´-OR. Importantly, 17 functioned as a balanced agonist promoting both G protein signaling and Î²-arrestin recruitment along with receptor endocytosis similar to the endorphins. Collectively these results demonstrate the burgeoning potential for marine natural products to serve as novel lead compounds for therapeutic targets in neuroscience research.},

  abstract        = {G protein-coupled receptor desensitization and trafficking are important regulators of opioid receptor signaling that can dictate overall drug responsiveness in vivo. Furthermore, different mu-opioid receptor (muOR) ligands can lead to varying degrees of receptor regulation, presumably because of distinct structural conformations conferred by agonist binding. For example, morphine binding produces a muOR with low affinity for beta-arrestin proteins and limited receptor internalization, whereas enkephalin analogs promote robust trafficking of both beta-arrestins and the receptors. Here, we evaluate muOR trafficking in response to activation by a novel mu-selective agonist derived from the naturally occurring plant product, salvinorin A. It is interesting that this compound, termed herkinorin, does not promote the recruitment of beta-arrestin-2 to the muOR and does not lead to receptor internalization. Moreover, whereas G protein-coupled receptor kinase overexpression can promote morphine-induced beta-arrestin interactions and muOR internalization, such manipulations do not promote herkinorin-induced trafficking. Studies in mice have shown that beta-arrestin-2 plays an important role in the development of morphine-induced tolerance, constipation, and respiratory depression. Therefore, drugs that can activate the receptor without recruiting the arrestins may be a promising step in the development of opiate analgesics that distinguish between agonist activity and receptor regulation and may ultimately lead to therapeutics designed to provide pain relief without the adverse side effects normally associated with the opiate narcotics.},

However, untoward side effects such as tolerance, dependence, respiratory suppression, constipation, and abuse liability detract from the general activation of these receptors. Studies in genetically modified rodent models suggest that activating G protein signaling pathways while avoiding phosphorylation of the receptor or recruitment of Î²-arrestin scaffolding proteins could preserve the analgesic properties of MOR agonists while avoiding certain side effects. With the development of novel MOR "biased" agonists, which lead to preferential activation of G protein pathways over receptor phosphorylation, internalization, or interaction with other effectors, this hypothesis can be tested in a native, physiological setting. Overall, it is clear that the MOR is not a simple on-off switch and that the diverse means by which the receptor can be regulated may present an opportunity to refine therapeutics for the treatment of pain.},

  abstract        = {G protein-coupled receptor-targeted drug discovery as well as "compound reassessment" requires the utilization of diverse screens to determine agonist efficacies and potencies beyond the scope of ligand binding and G protein coupling. Such efforts have arisen from extensive studies, both in cellular and animal models, demonstrating that these seven transmembrane domain-spanning, G protein-coupled receptors may engage in more diverse functions than their name suggests and particular focus is drawn to their interactions with beta-arrestins (betaarrestins). As regulators, betaarrestins are involved in dampening G protein-coupling pathways. betaArrestins can also play pro-signaling roles in receptor mediated events and the coupling of receptors to betaarrestins may be as important as their potential to couple to G proteins in the physiological setting. In the last decade, the development of betaarrestin deficient mouse models has allowed for the assessment of the contribution of individual betaarrestins to receptor function in vivo. This review will discuss the current literature that implicates betaarrestins in receptor function in respect to physiological and behavioral responses observed in the live animal model.},

Pharmacological approaches taken to preserve the analgesic properties, while eliminating the unwanted side effects, have met with very limited success. Here, we provide evidence that altering mu opioid receptor regulation may provide a novel approach to discriminate morphine's beneficial and deleterious effects in vivo. We have previously reported that mice lacking the G protein-coupled receptor regulatory protein, beta-arrestin 2, display profoundly altered morphine responses. beta-Arrestin 2 knockout mice have enhanced and prolonged morphine analgesia with very little morphine tolerance. In this report, we examine whether the side effects of morphine treatment are also augmented in this animal model. Surprisingly, the genetic disruption of opioid receptor regulation, while enhancing and prolonging analgesia, dramatically attenuates the respiratory suppression and acute constipation caused by morphine.},

  abstract        = {The reinforcing and psychomotor effects of morphine involve opiate stimulation of the dopaminergic system via activation of mu-opioid receptors (muOR). Both mu-opioid and dopamine receptors are members of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family of proteins. GPCRs are known to undergo desensitization involving phosphorylation of the receptor and the subsequent binding of beta(arrestins), which prevents further receptor-G-protein coupling. Mice lacking beta(arrestin)-2 (beta(arr2)) display enhanced sensitivity to morphine in tests of pain perception attributable to impaired desensitization of muOR. However, whether abrogating muOR desensitization affects the reinforcing and psychomotor properties of morphine has remained unexplored. In the present study, we examined this question by assessing the effects of morphine and cocaine on locomotor activity, behavioral sensitization, conditioned place preference, and striatal dopamine release in beta(arr2) knock-out (beta(arr2)-KO) mice and their wild-type (WT) controls. Cocaine treatment resulted in very similar neurochemical and behavioral responses between the genotypes. However, in the beta(arr2)-KO mice, morphine induced more pronounced increases in striatal extracellular dopamine than in WT mice. Moreover, the rewarding properties of morphine in the conditioned place preference test were greater in the beta(arr2)-KO mice when compared with the WT mice. Thus, beta(arr2) appears to play a more important role in the dopaminergic effects mediated by morphine than those induced by cocaine.},

  abstract        = {Morphine and other opiates mediate their effects through activation of the Î¼-opioid receptor (MOR), and regulation of the MOR has been shown to critically affect receptor responsiveness. Activation of the MOR results in receptor phosphorylation, Î²-arrestin recruitment, and internalization. This classical regulatory process can differ, depending on the ligand occupying the receptor. There are two forms of Î²-arrestin, Î²-arrestin1 and Î²-arrestin2 (also known as arrestin2 and arrestin3, respectively); however, most studies have focused on the consequences of recruiting Î²-arrestin2 specifically. In this study, we examine the different contributions of Î²-arrestin1- and Î²-arrestin2-mediated regulation of the MOR by comparing MOR agonists in cells that lack expression of individual or both Î²-arrestins. Here we show that morphine only recruits Î²-arrestin2, whereas the MOR-selective enkephalin [D-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO), recruits either Î²-arrestin. We show that Î²-arrestins are required for receptor internalization and that only Î²-arrestin2 can rescue morphine-induced MOR internalization, whereas either Î²-arrestin can rescue DAMGO-induced MOR internalization. DAMGO activation of the receptor promotes MOR ubiquitination over time. Interestingly, Î²-arrestin1 proves to be critical for MOR ubiquitination as modification does not occur in the absence of Î²-arrestin1 nor when morphine occupies the receptor. Moreover, the selective interactions between the MOR and Î²-arrestin1 facilitate receptor dephosphorylation, which may play a role in the resensitization of the MOR and thereby contribute to overall development of opioid tolerance.},

  abstract        = {Pain is a complex disorder with neurochemical and psychological components contributing to the severity, the persistence, and the difficulty in adequately treating the condition. Opioid and cannabinoids are two classes of analgesics that have been used to treat pain for centuries and are arguably the oldest of "pharmacological" interventions used by man. Unfortunately, they also produce several adverse side effects that can complicate pain management. Opioids and cannabinoids act at G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), and much of their effects are mediated by the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and cannabinoid CB1 receptor (CB1R), respectively. These receptors couple to intracellular second messengers and regulatory proteins to impart their biological effects. In this chapter, we review the role of the intracellular regulatory proteins, Î²-arrestins, in modulating MOR and CB1R and how they influence the analgesic and side-effect profiles of opioid and cannabinoid drugs in vivo. This review of the literature suggests that the development of opioid and cannabinoid agonists that bias MOR and CB1R toward G protein signaling cascades and away from Î²-arrestin interactions may provide a novel mechanism by which to produce analgesia with less severe adverse effects.},

GPCR activation is determined not only by the initiation of signaling cascades but also by regulatory mechanisms that control the extent and duration of their signals. The balance of activation and desensitization dictate the ultimate physiological response to both endogenous and exogenous receptor stimuli. Therefore, these mechanisms may play a particularly relevant role during chronic exposure to agonists such as in conditions when drugs are abused. Two major classes of drugs of abuse, opiates and psychostimulants, both use either direct or indirect GPCR signaling mechanisms to mediate their effects. Therefore, the regulation of GPCRs may have bearing on the neuronal adaptations that underlie the reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse.},

Functional deletion of the beta-arrestin 2 gene in mice resulted in remarkable potentiation and prolongation of the analgesic effect of morphine, suggesting that muOR desensitization was impaired. These results provide evidence in vivo for the physiological importance of beta-arrestin 2 in regulating the function of a specific GPCR, the muOR.

The development of opiate tolerance occurs on continued use of the drug such that the amount of drug required to elicit pain relief must be increased to compensate for diminished responsiveness. In many systems, decreased responsiveness to agonists has been correlated with the desensitization of G-protein-coupled receptors. In vitro evidence indicates that this process involves phosphorylation of G-protein-coupled receptors and subsequent binding of regulatory proteins called beta-arrestins. Using a knockout mouse lacking beta-arrestin-2 (beta arr2-/-), we have assessed the contribution of desensitization of the mu-opioid receptor to the development of morphine antinociceptive tolerance and the subsequent onset of physical dependence. Here we show that in mice lacking beta-arrestin-2, desensitization of the mu-opioid receptor does not occur after chronic morphine treatment, and that these animals fail to develop antinociceptive tolerance. However, the deletion of beta-arrestin-2 does not prevent the chronic morphine-induced up-regulation of adenylyl cyclase activity, a cellular marker of dependence, and the mutant mice still become physically dependent on the drug.},

Opioid receptors are abundant in multiple regions of the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system including enteric neurons. Opioid-related adverse effects such as constipation, nausea, and vomiting pose challenges for compliance and continuation of the therapy for chronic pain management. In the post-operative setting opioid-induced depression of respiration can be fatal. These critical limitations warrant a better understanding of their underpinning cellular and molecular mechanisms to inform the design of novel opioid analgesic molecules that are devoid of these unwanted side-effects. Research efforts on opioid receptor signalling in the past decade suggest that differential signalling pathways and downstream molecules preferentially mediate distinct pharmacological effects. Additionally, interaction among opioid receptors and, between opioid receptor and non-opioid receptors to form signalling complexes shows that opioid-induced receptor signalling is potentially more complicated than previously thought. This complexity provides an opportunity to identify and probe relationships between selective signalling pathway specificity and inÂ vivo production of opioid-related adverse effects. In this review, we focus on current knowledge of the mechanisms thought to transduce opioid-induced gastrointestinal adverse effects (constipation, nausea, vomiting) and respiratory depression.},

  abstract        = {Upon their discovery, beta-arrestins 1 and 2 were named for their capacity to sterically hinder the G protein coupling of agonist-activated seven-transmembrane receptors, ultimately resulting in receptor desensitization. Surprisingly, recent evidence shows that beta-arrestins can also function to activate signaling cascades independently of G protein activation. By serving as multiprotein scaffolds, the beta-arrestins bring elements of specific signaling pathways into close proximity. beta-Arrestin regulation has been demonstrated for an ever-increasing number of signaling molecules, including the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK, JNK, and p38 as well as Akt, PI3 kinase, and RhoA. In addition, investigators are discovering new roles for beta-arrestins in nuclear functions. Here, we review the signaling capacities of these versatile adapter molecules and discuss the possible implications for cellular processes such as chemotaxis and apoptosis.},

These complexes mediate receptor signaling, trafficking, and degradation. Moreover, beta-arrestins are increasingly found to perform analogous functions for receptors from structurally diverse classes, including atypical 7TMRs such as frizzled and smoothened, the nicotinic cholinergic receptors, receptor tyrosine kinases, and cytokine receptors, thereby regulating a growing list of cellular processes such as chemotaxis, apoptosis, and metastasis.},

In the case of 7TMRs, Î²-arrestins carry out these tasks while simultaneously inhibiting upstream G-protein-dependent signaling and promoting alternate downstream signaling pathways. The mechanisms by which Î²-arrestins interact with a continuously expanding ensemble of protein partners and perform their multiple functions including trafficking and signaling are currently being uncovered. Molecular changes at the level of protein conformation as well as post-translational modifications of Î²-arrestins probably form the basis for their dynamic interactions during receptor trafficking and signaling. It is becoming increasingly evident that Î²-arrestins, originally discovered as 7TMR adaptor proteins, indeed have much broader and more versatile roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. In this review paper, we assess the traditional and novel functions of Î²-arrestins and discuss the molecular attributes that might facilitate multiple interactions in regulating cell signaling and receptor trafficking.},

Distinguishing the respective contributions of Î²-arrestin recruitment to the receptor and Î²-arrestin-promoted endocytosis in propagating receptor signalling has been limited by the lack of selective analytical tools. Here, using a combination of virtual screening and cell-based assays, we have identified a small molecule that selectively inhibits the interaction between Î²-arrestin and the Î²2-adaptin subunit of the clathrin adaptor protein AP2 without interfering with the formation of receptor/Î²-arrestin complexes. This selective Î²-arrestin/Î²2-adaptin inhibitor (Barbadin) blocks agonist-promoted endocytosis of the prototypical Î²2-adrenergic (Î²2AR), V2-vasopressin (V2R) and angiotensin-II type-1 (AT1R) receptors, but does not affect Î²-arrestin-independent (transferrin) or AP2-independent (endothelin-A) receptor internalization. Interestingly, Barbadin fully blocks V2R-stimulated ERK1/2 activation and blunts cAMP accumulation promoted by both V2R and Î²2AR, supporting the concept of Î²-arrestin/AP2-dependent signalling for both G protein-dependent and -independent pathways.},

  abstract        = {Canonically, opioids influence cells by binding to a G protein-coupled opioid receptor, initiating intracellular signaling cascades, such as protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and extracellular receptor kinase pathways. This results in several downstream effects, including decreased levels of the reduced form of glutathione (GSH) and elevated oxidative stress, as well as epigenetic changes, especially in retrotransposons and heterochromatin, although the mechanism and consequences of these actions are unclear. We characterized the acute and long-term influence of morphine on redox and methylation status (including DNA methylation levels) in cultured neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. Acting via Î¼-opioid receptors, morphine inhibits excitatory amino acid transporter type 3-mediated cysteine uptake via multiple signaling pathways, involving different G proteins and protein kinases in a temporal manner. Decreased cysteine uptake was associated with decreases in both the redox and methylation status of neuronal cells, as defined by the ratios of GSH to oxidized forms of glutathione and S-adenosylmethionine to S-adenosylhomocysteine levels, respectively. Further, morphine induced global DNA methylation changes, including CpG sites in long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE-1) retrotransposons, resulting in increased LINE-1 mRNA. Together, these findings illuminate the mechanism by which morphine, and potentially other opioids, can influence neuronal-cell redox and methylation status including DNA methylation. Since epigenetic changes are implicated in drug addiction and tolerance phenomenon, this study could potentially extrapolate to elucidate a novel mechanism of action for other drugs of abuse.},

WE software can be used to control any dynamics engine, such as standard molecular dynamics and cell-modeling packages. This article reviews the theoretical basis of WE and goes on to describe successful applications to a number of complex biological processes-protein conformational transitions, (un)binding, and assembly processes, as well as cell-scale processes in systems biology. We furthermore discuss the challenges that need to be overcome in the next phase of WE methodological development.

  abstract        = {First-passage times (FPTs) are widely used to characterize stochastic processes such as chemical reactions, protein folding, diffusion processes or triggering a stock option. In previous work (Suarez et al., JCTC 2014;10:2658-2667), we demonstrated a non-Markovian analysis approach that, with a sufficient subset of history information, yields unbiased mean first-passage times from weighted-ensemble (WE) simulations. The estimation of the distribution of the first-passage times is, however, a more ambitious goal since it cannot be obtained by direct observation in WE trajectories. Likewise, a large number of events would be required to make a good estimation of the distribution from a regular "brute force" simulation. Here, we show how the previously developed non-Markovian analysis can generate approximate, but highly accurate, FPT distributions from WE data. The analysis can also be applied to any other unbiased trajectories, such as from standard molecular dynamics simulations. The present study employs a range of systems with independent verification of the distributions to demonstrate the success and limitations of the approach. By comparison to a standard Markov analysis, the non-Markovian approach is less sensitive to the user-defined discretization of configuration space.},

Trajectories are replicated and pruned in a way that focuses computational effort on underexplored regions of configuration space while maintaining rigorous kinetics. To enable the simulation of rare events at any scale (e.g., atomistic, cellular), we have developed an open-source, interoperable, and highly scalable software package for the execution and analysis of WE simulations: WESTPA (The Weighted Ensemble Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis). WESTPA scales to thousands of CPU cores and includes a suite of analysis tools that have been implemented in a massively parallel fashion. The software has been designed to interface conveniently with any dynamics engine and has already been used with a variety of molecular dynamics (e.g., GROMACS, NAMD, OpenMM, AMBER) and cell-modeling packages (e.g., BioNetGen, MCell). WESTPA has been in production use for over a year, and its utility has been demonstrated for a broad set of problems, ranging from atomically detailed hostâguest associations to nonspatial chemical kinetics of cellular signaling networks. The following describes the design and features of WESTPA, including the facilities it provides for running WE simulations and storing and analyzing WE simulation data, as well as examples of input and output.},

Molecular simulation has played an important role in elucidating the mechanism of ion conduction, but connecting atomistically detailed structural models of the protein to electrophysiological measurements remains a broad challenge due to the computational cost of reaching the necessary time scales. Here, we introduce an enhanced sampling method for simulating the conduction properties of narrow ion channels using the Weighted ensemble (WE) sampling approach. We demonstrate the application of this method to calculate the currentâvoltage relationship as well as the nonequilibrium ion distribution at steady-state of a simple model ion channel. By direct comparisons with long brute force simulations, we show that the WE simulations rigorously reproduce the correct long-time scale kinetics of the system and are capable of determining these quantities using significantly less aggregate simulation time under conditions where permeation events are rare.},

A total of 182 independent, continuous binding pathways were generated, yielding a kon that is in good agreement with experiment. These pathways were generated in 15 days using 3500 cores of a supercomputer, substantially faster than would be possible with "brute force" simulations. Many of these pathways involve the anchoring of p53 residue F19 into the MDM2 binding cleft when forming the metastable encounter complex, indicating that F19 may be a kinetically important residue. Our study demonstrates that it is now practical to generate pathways and calculate rate constants for protein binding processes using atomistic simulation on typical computing resources.},

This highly effective photoreceptor is known to be sensitive to the composition of its lipidic environment, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this fine-tuned modulation of the receptor's function and structural stability are not fully understood. There are two competing hypotheses to explain how this occurs: 1) lipid modulation occurs via solvent-like interactions, where lipid composition controls membrane properties like hydrophobic thickness, which in turn modulate the protein's conformational equilibrium; or 2) protein-lipid interactions are ligand-like, with specific hot spots and long-lived binding events. By analyzing an ensemble of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of five different states of rhodopsin, we show that a local ordering effect takes place in the membrane upon receptor activation. Likewise, docosahexaenoic acid acyl tails and phosphatidylethanolamine headgroups behave like weak ligands, preferentially binding to the receptor in inactive-like conformations and inducing subtle but significant structural changes.},

Here, we used microsecond-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to understand the specificity, selectivity, and structure of fengycin oligomers. Our simulations suggest that fengycin is more likely to form stable oligomers in model fungal membranes (phosphatidylcholine) compared to the model bacterial membranes (phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylglycerol).

Arrestin-3 is an elongated two-domain molecule with overall fold and key inter-domain interactions that hold the free protein in the basal conformation similar to the other subtypes. Arrestin-3 is the least selective member of the family, binding a wide variety of GPCRs with high affinity and demonstrating lower preference for active phosphorylated forms of the receptors. In contrast to the other three arrestins, part of the receptor-binding surface in the arrestin-3 C-domain does not form a contiguous Î²-sheet, which is consistent with increased flexibility. By swapping the corresponding elements between arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 we show that the presence of this loose structure is correlated with reduced arrestin selectivity for activated receptors, consistent with a conformational change in this Î²-sheet upon receptor binding.},

  abstract        = {Accurate in silico prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities has been a primary objective of structure-based drug design for decades due to the putative value it would bring to the drug discovery process. However, computational methods have historically failed to deliver value in real-world drug discovery applications due to a variety of scientific, technical, and practical challenges. Recently, a family of approaches commonly referred to as relative binding free energy (RBFE) calculations, which rely on physics-based molecular simulations and statistical mechanics, have shown promise in reliably generating accurate predictions in the context of drug discovery projects. This advance arises from accumulating developments in the underlying scientific methods (decades of research on force fields and sampling algorithms) coupled with vast increases in computational resources (graphics processing units and cloud infrastructures). Mounting evidence from retrospective validation studies, blind challenge predictions, and prospective applications suggests that RBFE simulations can now predict the affinity differences for congeneric ligands with sufficient accuracy and throughput to deliver considerable value in hit-to-lead and lead optimization efforts. Here, we present an overview of current RBFE implementations, highlighting recent advances and remaining challenges, along with examples that emphasize practical considerations for obtaining reliable RBFE results. We focus specifically on relative binding free energies because the calculations are less computationally intensive than absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations and map directly onto the hit-to-lead and lead optimization processes, where the prediction of relative binding energies between a reference molecule and new ideas (virtual molecules) can be used to prioritize molecules for synthesis. We describe the critical aspects of running RBFE calculations, from both theoretical and applied perspectives, using a combination of retrospective literature examples and prospective studies from drug discovery projects. This work is intended to provide a contemporary overview of the scientific, technical, and practical issues associated with running relative binding free energy simulations, with a focus on real-world drug discovery applications. We offer guidelines for improving the accuracy of RBFE simulations, especially for challenging cases, and emphasize unresolved issues that could be improved by further research in the field.},

  abstract     = {Accurate prediction of standard binding free energies describing protein:ligand association remains a daunting computational endeavor. This challenge is rooted to a large extent in the considerable changes in conformational, translational and rotational entropies underlying the binding process that atomistic simulations cannot easily capture. In spite of significant methodological advances, reflected in a continuously improving agreement with experiment, a characterization of alternate strategies aimed at measuring binding affinities, notably their respective advantages and drawbacks, is somewhat lacking. Here, two distinct avenues to determine the standard binding free energy are compared in the case of a short, proline-rich peptide associating to the Src homology domain 3 of tyrosine kinase Abl. These avenues - one relying upon alchemical transformations and the other on potentials of mean force (PMFs) - invoke a series of geometrical restraints acting on collective variables designed to alleviate sampling limitations inherent to classical molecular dynamics simulations. The experimental binding free energy of Î  = -7.99 kcal/mol is well reproduced by the two strategies developed herein, with Î  = -7.7 for the alchemical route and Î  = -7.8 kcal/mol for the alternate PMF-based route. In detailing the underpinnings of these numerical strategies devised for the accurate determination of standard binding free energies, many practical elements of the proposed rigorous, conceptual framework are clarified, thereby paving way to tackle virtually any recognition and association phenomenon.},

  abstract        = {We present a method to identify small molecule ligand binding sites and poses within a given protein crystal structure using GPU-accelerated Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations. The Hamiltonians used vary from the physical end state of protein interacting with the ligand to an unphysical end state where the ligand does not interact with the protein. As replicas explore the space of Hamiltonians interpolating between these states, the ligand can rapidly escape local minima and explore potential binding sites. Geometric restraints keep the ligands from leaving the vicinity of the protein and an alchemical pathway designed to increase phase space overlap between intermediates ensures good mixing. Because of the rigorous statistical mechanical nature of the Hamiltonian exchange framework, we can also extract binding free energy estimates for all putative binding sites. We present results of this methodology applied to the T4 lysozyme L99A model system for three known ligands and one non-binder as a control, using an implicit solvent. We find that our methodology identifies known crystallographic binding sites consistently and accurately for the small number of ligands considered here and gives free energies consistent with experiment. We are also able to analyze the contribution of individual binding sites to the overall binding affinity. Our methodology points to near term potential applications in early-stage structure-guided drug discovery.},

Sequencing the whole genome of a pathogen offers the potential to accurately determine which antibiotics will be effective to treat a patient. A key limitation of this approach is that it cannot classify rare or previously unseen mutations. Here we demonstrate that alchemical free energy methods, a well-established class of methods from computational chemistry, can successfully predict whether mutations in Staphylococcus aureus dihydrofolate reductase confer resistance to trimethoprim. We also show that the method is quantitatively accurate by calculating how much the most common resistance-conferring mutation, F99Y, reduces the binding free energy of trimethoprim and comparing predicted and experimentally measured minimum inhibitory concentrations for seven different mutations. Finally, by considering up to 32 free energy calculations for each mutation, we estimate its specificity and sensitivity.},

The enzyme is an asymmetric heterodimer of two subunits, p66 and p51. The two subunits have the same N-terminal sequence, with the p51 subunit lacking the C-terminal RNase H domain. We used hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry to probe the structural dynamics of RT. H/D exchange revealed that the fingers and palm subdomains of both subunits form the stable core of the heterodimer. In the crystal structure, the tertiary fold of the p51 subunit is more compact than that of the polymerase domain of the p66 subunit, yet both subunits show similar flexibility. The p66 subunit contains the polymerase and RNase H catalytic sites. H/D exchange indicated that the RNase H domain of p66 is very flexible. The beta-sheet beta12-beta13-beta14 lies at the base of the thumb subdomain of p66 and contains highly conserved residues involved in template/primer binding and NNRTI binding. Using the unique ability of hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry to resolve slowly interconverting species, we found that beta-sheet beta12-beta13-beta14 undergoes slow cooperative unfolding with a t(1/2) of <20 s. The H/D exchange results are discussed in relation to existing structural, simulation, and sequence information.},

NNRTIs are noncompetitive inhibitors that bind in a hydrophobic pocket in the p66 subunit of reverse transcriptase (RT) â¼10 Ã from the polymerase active site. Hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry (HXMS) shows that efavirenz binding reduces molecular flexibility in multiple regions of RT heterodimer in addition to the NNRTI binding site. Of the 47 peptic fragments monitored by HXMS, 15 showed significantly altered H/D exchange rates in the presence of efavirenz. The slow cooperative unfolding of a Î²-sheet in the NNRTI binding pocket, which was previously observed in unliganded RT, is dramatically suppressed by efavirenz. HXMS also defines an extensive network of allosterically coupled sites, including four distinct regions of allosteric stabilization, and one region of allosteric destabilization. The effects of efavirenz binding extend > 60 Ã from the NNRTI binding pocket. Allosteric changes to the structural dynamics propagate to the thumb and connection subdomains and RNase H domain of the p66 subunit as well as the thumb and palm subdomains of the p51 subunit.

  abstract        = {Efavirenz (EFV) is a potent nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) used in the treatment of AIDS. NNRTIs bind in a hydrophobic pocket located in the p66 subunit of reverse transcriptase (RT), which is not present in crystal structures of RT without an inhibitor. Recent studies showed that monomeric forms of the p66 and p51 subunits bind efavirenz with micromolar affinity. The effect of efavirenz on the solution conformations of p66 and p51 monomers was studied by hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HXMS) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS). HXMS data reveal that five peptides, four of which contain efavirenz contact residues seen in the crystal structure of the RT-EFV complex, exhibit a reduced level of exchange in monomer-EFV complexes. Moreover, peptide 232-246 undergoes slow cooperative unfolding-refolding in the bound monomers, but at a rate much slower than that observed in the p66 subunit of the RT heterodimer [Seckler, J. M., Howard, K. J., Barkley, M. D., and Wintrode, P. L. (2009) Biochemistry 48, 7646-7655]. These results suggest that the efavirenz binding site on p66 and p51 monomers is similar to the NNRTI binding pocket in the p66 subunit of RT. Nanoelectrospray ionization FT-ICR mass spectra indicate that the intact monomers each have (at least) two different conformations. In the presence of efavirenz, the mass spectra change significantly and suggest that p51 adopts a single, more compact conformation, whereas p66 undergoes facile, electrospray-induced cleavage. The population shift is consistent with a selected-fit binding mechanism.},
