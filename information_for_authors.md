# Using LiveCoMS templates for your own living document

## Getting started

To get started with our template, clone [this repository](https://github.com/livecomsjournal/article_templates) by clicking the "clone or download button" and download a `.zip` file. 
Then navigate to the `templates` directory, copy the files to where you will be working, and get started!

## After Forking

Edit `your.README.md` and move it to `READ.md`, and you are set to write the article in your own repository. 
You can also delete the `example.tex` files that don't match your article type.
