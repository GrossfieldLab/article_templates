# Submission handling for the Living Journal of Computational Molecular Sciences ([LiveCoMS](http://www.livecomsjournal.org/))

## About the journal

LiveCoMS strives to advance science and education in the computational molecular sciences via a new way of publishing.
We focus on publishing several types of living documents or [perpetual review papers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01329), providing authors a mechanism to publish and maintain authoritative works which are regularly updated with community input, while still getting formal publication credit for these articles. 
We focus especially on three major types of such documents:
- Perpetual reviews, including up-to-date traditional reviews as well as best practices documents
- Tutorials
- Comparisons between simulation packages
Our focus is on documents which require ongoing updates to stay current.

LiveCoMS is an *overlay journal*, and does not host articles; rather, it "publishes" preprints.
Articles submitted to LiveCoMS are preprints (using our LaTeX templates) permanently archived elsewhere; we provide peer reviews of these, then link to and highlight them, increasing their visibility and providing them with formal status as peer-reviewed publications. 

## What's here

Here we (will) provide:
- Our LaTeX template
- An example article using the template, with links to others
- LaTeX formatting tips for using our template well in combination with GitHub
- A brief explanation of "paper writing as code development", the model we recommend for LiveCoMS


## LaTeX templates

This repository provides LaTeX templates to prepare articles for LiveCoMS. Our templates are adapted from the eLife Overleaf templates (v1.4; obtained 8/102017). 
Our templates (as eLife's) are available under the [CC-BY-4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Our template files, including a LaTeX template (which itself provides an example, including text and figures), a bibliography style file, and a class, are available in the `templates` directory. 

**To get started with our template, clone this repository or click the "clone or download button" and download a zip file. Then navigate to the `templates` directory, copy the files to where you will be working, and get started!**
